PRO (Patient Reported Outcomes) is an umbrella term that covers a whole range of potential types of measurement but is used specifically to refer to questionnaires completed by the patient. PRO data may be collected via self-administered questionnaires completed by the patient or via interviewer-administered questionnaires. The latter will only qualify as a PRO where the interviewer is gaining the patient   s views, not where the interviewer uses patient responses to make a professional assessment or judgment of the impact of the patient   s condition. Thus, PROs are a means of gathering patient rather than clinical or other views on the content covered by the questionnaire.  
The term ePRO is used for electronic Patient Reported Outcomes.  ePRO data is collected electronically via a range of devices including handheld PDA, PC or mobile / cell phone. The term mPRO refers specifically to the collection of PRO data on a mobile / cell phone.
The most commonly used PRO questionnaires assess one of the following constructs:
Questionnaires may be generic (designed to be used in any disease population and cover a broad aspect of the construct measured) or condition-specific (developed speficially to measure those aspects of outcome that are of importance for a people with a particular medical condition).
