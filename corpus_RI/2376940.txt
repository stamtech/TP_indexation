Currently, major cities in the 319 code include Burlington, Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids, Oelwein, Fort Madison, Iowa City, Keokuk, and Waterloo.
By the end of the 20th century, it was felt that the 319 code was running out of available numbers due to the increase in mobile devices, lines for computer equipment, FAX machines, and other services.  In late 2000 it was announced that a new 563 area code would be assigned to Iowa.  Cell phone service providers hoped that it would be an overlay since it would not require reprogramming of cell phones.  In the end, it was decided that a geographic split would be employed.  As a result the cities of Bettendorf, Clinton, Davenport, Decorah, and Dubuque were all moved to the new 563 area code.  The new code became operational in March 2001, and became mandatory in December 2001.
