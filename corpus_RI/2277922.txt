The Volvo '''Modular engine''' is a family of straight-4, straight-5, and straight-6 automobile piston engine produced from the first year Volvo 960 appeared with the B6304F engine (1990).  It has an aluminium engine block and aluminium 4-valve DOHC cylinder heads and uses SFI fuel injection and has fracture-split forged steel connecting rods.  All are built in Skovde, Sweden.
The first five characters are as follows:

Applications:
Features a TD04HL-16T turbo in the 850 R and a TD04HL-18T turbo in the S/V70R.  Standard turbo for the 850 T5 and automatic R was a TD04HL-15G and for the S/V70 T5 a TD04HL-16T.  The larger turbos along with different ECU mapping allowed the B5234T4 to produce a published 250 hp at 6000 rpm.  All cars equipped with the B5234T4 used Motronic 4.4 engine management, even the 1997 850 R when all other 850 turbos were run on Motronic 4.3.

Applications:
The '''B5254T2-R''' has dual VVT and is turbocharged and intercooled.  
Output is 300 hp (220 kW) at 5500 rpm with 295 ft  lbf (400 N m) of torque at 1950-5250 rpm with the 6 speed M66AWD (Ford/Getrag) manual transmission. 
The 6 speed TF-SC80 automatic transmission is not limited (2006-2007).
Applications:
It has VVT and is turbocharged and intercooled. Unlike previous designs, the turbocharger is integral with the exhaust manifold. It uses the Bosch ME 9.0 engine management system. 
Using the M66W (FWD) or M66C (AWD) manual transmission output is  230&nbsp;hp (168&nbsp;kW) at 5000&nbsp;rpm with 236&nbsp;ft  lbf (320&nbsp;N m) of torque at 1500-4800&nbsp;rpm.  With the AW55-51 automatic transmission, torque is limited in first and second gear. 
Applications:
The '''B5254T7''' is a slight adaptation of the B5254T3. It has VVT and is turbocharged and intercooled. The turbocharger is still integrated into the exhaust manifold, but is of a different design. 
Using the M66W (FWD) or M66C (AWD) manual transmission output is  227&nbsp;hp (169&nbsp;kW) at 5000&nbsp;rpm with 236&nbsp;ft  lbf (320&nbsp;N m) of torque at 1500-5000&nbsp;rpm. With the AW55-51 automatic transmission, torque is limited in first and second gear. 
Applications:
The Volvo '''B62''' is a straight-6 automobile piston engine produced in the 2000s.  It has an aluminium engine block and aluminium DOHC cylinder heads.  It uses SFI fuel injection, has 4 valves per cylinder with  and features fracture-split forged steel connecting rods.
The '''B6294''' is a 2.9&nbsp;L (2922&nbsp;cc) straight-6 built in Skovde, Sweden.

This engine is based on the B6304 (see below), but refined for transverse mounting and variable valve timing.
Applications:
The '''B6294T''' is a 2.9&nbsp;L (2922&nbsp;cc) version built in Skovde, Sweden.  Bore is 83&nbsp;mm and stroke is 90.3&nbsp;mm.  Output is 268&nbsp;hp (200&nbsp;kW) at 5200&nbsp;rpm with 280&nbsp;ft  lbf (380&nbsp;N m) of torque at 1800-5000&nbsp;rpm.  It has two turbochargers and is intercooled.
Applications:
The B6304S was the first generation of modular inline-6 engines. It has the same bore and stroke (83x90 mm) as the B6294, but the deciliter number was rounded up (i.e. 2,922 cc to 3,000 cc). These engines produced  at 6000 rpm, and  of torque at 4,300 rpm. Engine output was reduced to   and  by changing the cam profile (back then without variable valve timing) in favor of emissions regulations.
To develop this new, modular engine type, Volvo had a cooperation project with Porsche / Weissach.
Applications:
A new, small 2.5-litre engine, known as the B6254 FS, was introduced for the 1995 Volvo 960. It developed  at 5,700&nbsp;rpm and maximum torque of 230&nbsp;Nm at 4,400&nbsp;rpm. This engine was identical in every way to the larger B6304S, apart from the stroke being reduced to 80&nbsp;mm and the bore to 81&nbsp;mm, producing a displacement of 2,473 cc. Like other Volvo engines, it was optimised for low-end and middle range torque. 
Applications:
Non-catalyst, leaded-fuel compatible version of the B6254S, for regions with limited availability of unleaded fuel.
