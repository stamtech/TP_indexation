Middletown is a principal city of the Poughkeepsie   Newburgh   Middletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes all of Dutchess and Orange counties. The two-county MSA had a population of 621,517 at the 2000 census. A July 1, 2007 estimate placed the population at 669,915. The city also lies along the northern boundary of the New York metropolitan area.
John Green purchased land from the DeLancey patent and probably settled the area around 1744. Due to its location between other pre-existing locations, the name of Middletown was adopted, but later changed to South Middletown to avoid confusion with another nearby location.  Eventually the word "south" was dropped, giving the current name when the community became a village in 1848. The village was incorporated as a city in 1888.
The First Congregational Church of Middletown, established in 1785, has the highest spire downtown. It can be argued that the construction of the church marks the beginning of Middletown's existence as a village. The current building was constructed in 1872.
Middletown grew up with the Erie Railroad and the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (among others) and attracted a number of employers, such as shoe, lawnmower blade, and furniture factories, but most of these businesses had closed by the 1960s. The closing of a large Ford Motor Company plant in Mahwah, New Jersey, and the downsizing of IBM operations in the area were a blow to the economy of Middletown and surrounding communities in the 1970s.
However, quite a few New York City police officers, firefighters and other workers moved up to the area, especially beginning in the 1970s, to purchase houses that were much less expensive than those nearer the city. These long-distance commuters helped to bolster the economy of the area.  After New York City required its municipal employees to be resident in the city in 1986, however, Middletown lost this source of growth.  The only railroad left in town is the Middletown and New Jersey Railway.
The downtown business district of Middletown suffered from the growth of the "Miracle Mile" shopping strip and Lloyd's Supermarket in the late 1960s and later two malls, all located at the eastern edge of town, along Route 211, near Route 17 and Interstate 84.  The Orange Plaza mall drew several of the downtown shops into it by the mid 1970s, and to the East across Route 17, the Galleria mall opened in the early 1990s.  A Super-WalMart replaced the Orange Plaza mall in 2001.  Some of the buildings downtown are abandoned or underutilized, although there has long been an active downtown bar scene, and there are restaurants downtown.
The downtown area has a number of historic churches, and Highland Avenue has a number of large Victorian houses. Many of these are occupied by medical doctors and their families, with a section devoted to the doctor's office. Some of the largest Victorians are now used as nursing homes. There are some prosperous neighborhoods, such as Presidential Heights, but there are many less prosperous neighborhoods.  The surrounding countryside was devoted partly to small dairy farms, but this has waned since the 1980s.
Middletown is the main business address for Mediacom Communications Corp and its related entities, a cable and other pay TV company.  Their headquarters building is actually located outside the city in the Town of Wallkill.
Shopping in the area includes the Galleria at Crystal Run, a mall just East of Middletown, and a long retail strip along Route 211 on the East side of town.  The downtown area, particularly North Street and East/West Main Street, has a variety of ethnic eateries and various small shops. There is also a children's science museum and a number of churches in the neighborhood.  The city also has movie theaters, the historic Paramount Theatre, Federal Courthouse, a local arts council, bowling alleys, WALL and WOSR radio stations and Thrall Library downtown.  There is also active participation in Boy Scouts of America and Girl Scouts of the USA, Lions Club, Elks Club, Kiwanis, Rotary Club and other service clubs. The Rotary Club runs an annual Horse Show at Fancher Davidge Park each fall.  Middletown is also home to the Orange County Fair each summer.  
SUNY Orange, previously known as Orange County Community College, is located in Middletown (and includes the beautiful Webb Horton House, more commonly known as Morrison Hall), as is Horton Memorial Hospital and the Middletown Psychiatric Center (a major employer). The local newspaper is called the ''Times Herald-Record'', the first cold press offset daily in the country.  Middletown is home to works of two prominent architects: Hillside Cemetery, designed by prominent British architect and landscape designer Calvert Vaux, who also designed New York City's Central Park with Frederick Law Olmsted; and J. W. Chorley Elementary School, designed by American architect Paul Rudolph, while serving as Dean of the Yale School of Architecture.  The Highland Lakes State Park is the nearest State Park, and there are good choices for hiking, biking, and country drives nearby.  
Retail businesses in Middletown are often referenced in the phone calls of The Jerky Boys, including the Route 211 Taco Bell in "Civil War Memorabilia (Part 2)", from ''The Jerky Boys 3'', and the Middletown Motel and International Golf Discount in "What's Wrong With This World" from 2000's ''The Jerky Tapes''.
