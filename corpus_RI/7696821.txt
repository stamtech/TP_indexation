The song's accompanying music video was directed by Matthew Rolston, and depicts scenes of Cyrus climbing a mountain or singing, intercut with clips of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. Cyrus promoted the song with several live performances. The first, at the   event on January 19, 2009, was the first time the song had ever been publicly heard. Cyrus also performed the song as the closing number of her Wonder World Tour. The song is also a part of her Gypsy Heart Tour. "The Climb" has been covered by several artists and was the most popular choice of song among auditioners for the ninth season of the American singing contest, ''American Idol''. Simon Cowell, creator of the British television talent show ''The X Factor'', chose "The Climb" to be the debut single of the winner of the competition's sixth series. Winner Joe McElderry's cover, released on December 14, 2009 by Syco Music, was produced by Quiz & Larossi and topped the Irish Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart.
The song they created was titled "It's the Climb" and was written in third person. Alexander described the original song as "more spiritual" than the version that was released, and said it contained lines about prayer. However, she claimed she knew it was pop and suitable for The Walt Disney Company.
Before reaching Cyrus, the song had been rejected by several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'', who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become "The Climb" while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for ''Hannah Montana: The Movie''. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded "It's the Climb" on a CD and gave it to him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that "the song was gonna be an integral part of the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a "substantial amount of the song" and commented, "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." She and Mabe "wrestl over taking words out" and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity. After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was "perfect for the movie".
Upon receiving the final draft, filmmakers told the songwriters, "This is perfect for Miley, it   s gonna change her life, gonna change your life." Chelsom commented that the song "turned up" the film's music level by tapping into Cyrus's newfound vocal range. As with the other songs featured in ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'', the song is "tightly woven into the fabric of the story and the characters". In the film, Cyrus plays Miley Stewart, a character with a secret double life as superstar Hannah Montana. Keeping this secret causes trouble between Miley and many of the other characters in the film, and leaves Miley confused and contrite. She expresses her emotions by writing "The Climb". According to film producer Alfred Gough, "The song is her journey, the lessons she's learned in the movie. It's an epic  power ballad that encapsulates Miley's journey and the message of the film."
According to music reviewer Fraser McAlpine of the BBC, the song's lyrics assert that life should be viewed as "a journey which is difficult but rewarding". Both Martens and McAlpine took special interest in the line "It's always gonna be an uphill battle/Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose". Martens interpreted the line as an acknowledgment by the singer of her own mistakes in life, while McAlpine wrote, "In this song which is about plugging away at things, the writers have slipped in  that the occasional setback isn't the end of the world."
 Wesley Morris of ''The Boston Globe'' praised "The Climb" for being a "pretty liberation anthem". Leah Greenblatt of ''Entertainment Weekly'' said, "On tunes like  'The Climb', the 16-year-old Tennessee native turns up her homegrown inflections, but a few elongated r's won't exactly shut out her huge pop audience." Todd Martens of ''The Los Angeles Times'' believed that "The Climb" was "buried in cheese" and described it as "pre-Valentine's Day gooeyness". However, Martens said, "'The Climb' is the rare Miley ballad that's on par with some of her more spunky teen pop."
 Hann said the song was added to the extended play in order to "add some ballast since this collection's US release." Jon Caraminica of ''The New York Times'' described "The Climb" as an "appealing new single  is just the sort of demure, inspirational country-rock that could easily be mistaken for self-reckoning." While reviewing a concert performance, James Reed of ''The Boston Globe'' called the song "bland but inspirational fare".
On the week ending March 7, 2009, "The Climb" debuted at number forty-eight on ''Billboard'''s Hot Country Songs. It was, incidentally, the same week that "Back to Tennessee", by Cyrus's father, Billy Ray Cyrus, debuted at number fifty-nine, the first time a father and daughter had separate charting songs on the chart since Johnny and Rosanne Cash charted in 1990 with "Silver Stallion" and "One Step over the Line", respectively.

 With its peak at number eleven, it tied for Cyrus's best-charting effort on the chart with "See You Again" from October 2008.

 which premiered on Cyrus's MySpace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences with a shot of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At the end of the valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing "The Climb" beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play in the same manner as the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.
Bill Lamb of About.com said the video took an "inspirational approach". Todd Martens of ''The Los Angeles Times'' wrote that while he enjoyed the song, he was unsure about the video. He commented that while the video was an improvement since Cyrus's video for "7 Things" (2008), the settings in "The Climb" music video looked as though they had been painted by Thomas Kinkade and Cyrus's dancing appeared off-beat. Travis of MTV described the video as "beautifully shot (although heavily digitized)". Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music remarked that the summit setting was similar to that of the music video for Britney Spears' "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". Parker also felt the scene in which Cyrus looks out over the cliff, shot using large sweeps with an aerial camera, had been "lifted straight out of an '80s Bon Jovi video". In 2009, the video received a MuchMusic Video nomination for Best International Artist Video, but lost to Lady Gaga's music video for "Poker Face".
Cyrus opened the   event with the premiere of "The Climb". The event was held on January 19, 2009, in Washington D.C. at the Verizon Center to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States. Cyrus, dressed in an embroidered red ball gown made by Reem Acra, dedicated the song to Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia Obama. Following the song's official release in March 2009, Cyrus resumed promotion for "The Climb", performing live for shows including ''American Idol'', ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', the 44th annual Academy of Country Music Awards, ''Good Morning America'', and ''Live with Regis and Kelly'' throughout April. On April 13, Cyrus performed "The Climb" as part of her set for the AOL Sessions. On April 24, Cyrus sang "The Climb" and other songs in a London Apple Store. The performances were recorded and sold exclusively by the United Kingdom iTunes Store as a live extended play titled ''iTunes Live from London''. On June 7, 2009, Cyrus performed the song at the 20th annual A Time for Heroes Celebrity Carnival, an outdoor carnival supporting the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Cyrus also sang "The Climb" on ''The Today Show'' on August 28 and at the first D23 Expo on September 11, 2009.
To promote the ''Hannah Montana: The Movie'' soundtrack, Cyrus performed "The Climb" on a six-day, five-city acoustic radio promo tour that reached over 250 radio shows.
Cyrus added the song to her current tour, Gypsy Heart Tour.
Kidz Bop Kids recorded a cover of the song for ''Kidz Bop 16''. Heather Phares of Allmusic commented, "The Kidz Bop Kids' version of Miley Cyrus' 'The Climb' sounds like an especially good elementary school choir performance". Thia Megia, aged 14, performed a cover version of "The Climb" while competing in the semi-final of ''America's Got Talent''. Her performance was well received by the judges, with praise from Sharon Osbourne for her age-appropriate choice. Australian singer Stan Walker performed the song as a contestant on the seventh season of ''Australian Idol''. After winning the competition, he recorded the song for his debut album, ''Introducing... Stan Walker''. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic said the cover turned out "well in large part because of Walker's vocal talents".  ''American Idol'' finalist Haeley Vaughn performed the song during the top twenty rounds of the ninth season.  The following season, contestant Lauren Alaina performed the song during Idol Goes to the Movies week.  The song was covered by Lea Michele, portraying Rachel Berry, in the 2010 ''Glee'' episode "Laryngitis".  Filipino singer Charice has also done a live cover of this song.  Filipino acoustic singer Davey Langit also covered the song. The YouTube-founded R&B group, Ahmir also created a cover for the Climb, this cover is considered to be one of the best. The song was covered by Star Academy Middle East contestant Christine Saade from Lebanon during the 10th week evaluation. Christine stated that the song was dedicated to her grandfather who died during the competition, but cried during her performance, which resulted to her being nominated for the Bottom 3. She was saved by the other candidate's votes with 7/11 of the voting process. Australian born singer Luke Cheung recorded a cover of the song for the 2010 album Life in Auto-Tune.
In the same year of "The Climb"'s original release, British executive Simon Cowell chose for Joe McElderry, Olly Murs, and Stacey Solomon, the three finalists of the sixth series of the British television talent contest ''The X Factor'', to record the song in preparation for a single release as soon as the winner was announced. After Solomon's elimination, Murs and McElderry sang the song on December 13, 2009, as their final performance in the competition. Upon winning the competition, McElderry's version of "The Climb", produced by Quiz & Larossi, was released on December 14, 2009 by Syco Music as the first single from his album ''Wide Awake'' (2010). McElderry said that the lyrics to "The Climb" meant a lot to him: "It's an emotional song because it's what's been happening in the last few months. It all feels very, very surreal." According to Peter Robinson of ''The Guardian'', the cover has a "plinky" piano in its introduction. In regards to lyrics, Robinson interpreted, "lines about 'uphill battles' and 'having to lose' do seem to talk of Joe's probable future."
Peter Robinson of ''The Guardian'' described "The Climb" as a "controversially uncontroversial choice" for a cover and continued, "While 'The Climb' might be a suitable choice for a winner's single, the fact that it's a cover of such a recent song means that it's still slightly odd."
On the week ending December 26, 2009, "The Climb" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart; its debut position was influenced by a campaign composed of Facebook group members, aimed at getting Rage Against the Machine's "Killing in the Name" (1992) to the top position during Christmas week. In the following week, the song reached number one, where it maintained for a week. The single was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments exceeding 600,000 copies. "The Climb" debuted at number one on the Irish Singles Chart on the week ending December 17, 2009, where it maintained in the top position for four consecutive weeks. In mainland Europe, the song charted in the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles at number four on the week ending January 9, 2010.
The video was shot on December 16, 2009, in London, England. The video begins with footage from ''The X-Factor'' and then transitions to a close-up shot of McElderry in the main setting, a flooded cityscape     the scene was shot in a flooded set with a cityscape backdrop. McElderry is clothed by a gray vest and a gray shirt, as he stands in the setting and performs. Throughout the entire video, scenes alternate between the flooded cityscape setting and recycled footage from ''The X Factor'', which are in black and white until it shows him in the live shows in color. The video concludes with McElderry being informed he won the competition, hugging his peers.
