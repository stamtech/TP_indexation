The '''Volvo 850''' is a compact executive car produced by Volvo Cars from 1992 to 1997 and designed by Jan Wilsgaard.  Available in sedan/saloon and station wagon/estate body styles, the Volvo 850 was notable as the first front-wheel drive vehicle from this Swedish manufacturer to be exported to North America. It is often considered the vehicle that gave Volvo its reputation as a high-end auto maker in North America due to the level of features available in this model that were not offered in previous models. At the time of its development, the 850 was regarded as one of the largest engineering endeavours in Sweden.
The Volvo 850 was introduced worldwide as a 1992 model, but arrived in the United States in the 1993 model year.  It was sold as a saloon (sedan) with an estate (wagon) model on sale from 1992 in Europe.  The 850 was the first Volvo model in North America to feature front-wheel drive and an all-aluminium alloy 20-valve straight-five engine.  The 850 was Volvo's top-seller in the mid-1990s.  In markets outside the U.S., a 10-valve variant of the five-cylinder was popular for its lower cost and better fuel economy.
All U.S. 850s received standard equipment such as dual front airbags, anti-lock braking system, head restraints and three-point seat belts for all passengers, power windows, door locks, and mirrors, cruise control, and dual zone climate control.  Side torso airbags became a world first when introduced as an option for 1995.  Some other options during the model run included features such as traction control, leather interior, power glass sunroof, power seats, heated seats, remote keyless entry, automatic climate control, and automatic transmission.
The 850 saloon features an interior space of .  This is slightly more than the  of the 2004 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, even though the car is reasonably compact on the outside.  This space is achieved by mounting the in-line 5-cylinder engine transversely (from the left to the right of the car) under the hood.  The road-holding and handling are vastly improved over the previous rear-wheel drive Volvos.
The 850 Turbo estate is capable of top speeds in excess of  when ungoverned.  Production models of the estate and saloon are electronically governed to approximately .
In 1995, a limited-edition version, labeled T-5R, was sold worldwide.
From 1996-1998, a high-end model, the R, was produced.  It was based on the aforementioned T-5R.
In 1996 a "Platinum" edition of the 850 Turbo was available.  The exterior paint for these models came in a metallic pearl platinum-color and had special 16&nbsp;inch alloy wheels.  The interior was fitted with leather seats and burled walnut accents.  Only 1,500 of these were imported for the U.S. market.
For the last model year (1996/1997), the 850  AWD (All Wheel Drive) model was introduced with a new  low pressure turbo 2.4&nbsp;litre engine (B5254T).
In 1998, the model line was updated, and renamed the Volvo S70 (saloon) and Volvo V70 (estate).  These vehicles were sold in the U.S. through the 2000 model year when there were still many 850's waiting to be sold.  This allowed for an alternatively designed vehicle; the 2001 Volvo S60 and Volvo V70, during the 850's production hiatus.
For the 850, Volvo created what it called "Delta-link semi-independent rear suspension". Volvo held a U.S. patent for rear axle bushings that compress under load, giving the Volvo 850 passive rear steering. The automobile also has a tight turning circle, , and is considered very maneuverable. By comparison, later large Volvos had a  turning circle.
Legendary Australian race driver Peter Brock drove a Volvo 850 touring car in a one-off Bathurst 12-hour endurance event in 1994, and drove the car in the 1996 Australian Super Touring Championship. Volvo joined forces with the famous and very successful Tom Walkinshaw Racing team (TWR) in 1994 to build an 850 Estate touring car to compete in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC). Despite much criticism, the 850 Estate performed well, with a best placed finish of fifth, and a best qualifying spot of third. It was driven by Rickard Rydell and Jan Lammers and Volvo finished sixth in manufacturers' standings in the 1994 season. In 1995, TWR and Volvo built the 850 Saloon BTCC Racer and this won five races, qualified on pole position 13 times with Rickard Rydell and Tim Harvey and finished third in the championship. The switch was due mainly to the change in BTCC regulations which allowed aerodynamic aids (spoilers) which effectively ended any chance of the Estate being fully competitive. In 1996, an improved 850 saloon raced which boasted eight wins with Rickard Rydell and Kelvin Burt and finished third in the championship. Volvo were also prevalent with the 850 in championships across Europe and in Australia.
The T-5R sold out in short time, leading Volvo to repeat the T-5R the following year as the 850 R. 
The Volvo 850 T-5R was also noted for its safety features.  It was the first automobile to have four airbags standard.  The side airbags were installed in the seat cushions.  German automakers would soon follow with their own side airbags as well, however, they were installed in the doors.  The side airbags followed into all Volvos the following year as an option and became standard on the full-line a year after that, before other manufacturers began offering them as an option, in particular American and Japanese automakers.  The same occurred with Volvo's introduction of daytime-running headlamps.  The automobile also came with the first integrated child booster seat in the rear cabin. It was also the first sedan to have three-point seatbelts at all five seating positions.  Volvo would later debut the side curtain airbag a couple of years later in the S80 and make those standard on the full line of autos before other manufacturers as well, though Lexus followed only months later.
Also included in the 1995 T-5R package is a front bumper with a lip, rear spoiler, side skirts, polished aluminum door sills, special graphite leather like that of the Porsche 911 and Alcantara (the fire-retardant version of Toray Industries' Ultrasuede (tm)) seats in dark grey like that of the Porsche 911 Turbo and a black interior with deep walnut wood grain accents.  Both yellow and black versions came with the same black interior as the only choice.  The T-5R had an additional badge to the left of the "850" on the trunk, referred to as "The Motorsport badge".   The standard wheels were the titanium-gray 5-spoke 17  7 "Titan".  1995 was the only year that the a model was badged as a "T-5R".  
5500 T-5Rs were produced worldwide, of which 2000 went to the US:
The 1995 850 T-5R was limited in exterior paint color choices:
The 1996 and 1997 Volvo 850R also came as a Sport Wagon. In 5-door form, the turbocharged wagon can accelerate from 0-60&nbsp;mph in 6.7 seconds and reach up to .
For the Italian market, the R was based on the 2.0 litre 850 Turbo. The transmission was the standard AW/50-42 used in all U.S. 850's, the M56H being available in other countries.
All manufacturer's suggested retail prices (MSRPs) are base prices only.
All 1993 850 models were badged GLT, regardless of equipment. Many options (leather, sunroof, and more) were bundled into the Touring package.
The 1994 850 includes revised headlights, front valances, and front and rear bumpers. The GLT badge is dropped, although all the same equipment is available. The  Turbo sedan and wagon, as well as the normally aspirated  wagon, are new models this year.
The GLT badge returned for the 1995 model year, so there were now sedan and wagon versions of the 850, 850 GLT, 850 Turbo, and 850 T-5R. The T-5R was the new high performance model, with more power stemming from ECU tuning, and special suspension, trim and wheels. In addition to the introduction of the T-5R, changes included new tail-lights for sedans, optional side airbags for all variants, new interior switch-gear design and several other detail changes.
Australian delivered 850 SEs were provided with the B5252 10 valve motor, which was labelled DOHC on the cam cover. 
Changes this year include a revised power door lock system, new exterior colors, and full OBD-II compliance. The T-5R high performance version became the R in 1996, but the performance differences remained relatively the same.
The United Kingdom received 2.5 10v and 2.5 20v versions, which were unavailable in the U.S. and Canada, but made their way to Russia and Switzerland.
For 1997, the 850's final year, all GLT models were increased to 190&nbsp;hp (142&nbsp;kW) by pairing a low-pressure turbocharger with the 2.4&nbsp;L engine. The 850 Turbo model was thence called the 850 T-5, as it always had been in the UK. The 1997 model year was short, as the substantially similar (virtually identical except for superficial styling changes) Volvo S70 sedan and Volvo V70 wagon were introduced during the first half of 1997 shortly before '''Ford Motor Co'''. took over Volvo in 1998.
Also in 1997 Volvo released the 850 AWD to the European/Canadian market with the same motor as the 1997 GLT 2.4 L I5 LPT (13G) it was only available with a 5 speed m58 transmission. It is believed that 214 850 AWD's were imported to Canada for 1997. It had an m56 with an added bevel gear (transfer case) created the m58 transmission. In 1998 AWD versions were only avaliable in automatic except in Europe and Canada although it is believed that 7 V70 AWD Manuals were imported to Canada.
