Luske learned poker in market cafes. He officially quit his job as a salesman in 2003 to concentrate on poker. 
Luske made two appearances on the television show ''Late Night Poker'' (episodes 4.6 and 6.2) but did not fare well in either event, won by Barny Boatman and John Duthie respectively.
Luske finished in 14th place in the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event and 10th place in the 2004 WSOP Main Event. In the latter tournament, Luske won $373,000 and finished just one spot away from making the final table. These achievements in the 2003 and 2004 WSOP Main Events rank second behind only Dan Harrington's back-to-back final tables those years. In fact, it was Harrington who eliminated Luske in 2004. He has numerous money finishes at the WSOP, including a 2nd place finish to Joe Awada in the 2004 $5,000 Seven-card stud tournament, for which he earned $120,800.
Luske has won the European Poker Awards Player of the Year twice, in 2001 and 2004.
In March 2005, Luske correctly predicted Rob Hollink would win the European Poker Tour grand final. The following year Luske himself made the EPT championship grand final, finishing 7th.
In July 2005, he won the    10,000 Hall of Fame Poker Classic in Paris, France, where he took home    119,000.
Luske was the first person to be eliminated in the World Series of Poker Europe, during the inaugural    2,500 H.O.R.S.E. event, in September 2007.
 His 20 cashes as the WSOP account for $1,173,396 of those winnings.
Luske mentored David Williams (runner-up of the 2004 World Series of Poker) in poker. He is also the mentor of Russian poker professional Kirill Gerasimov, the runner-up of the World Poker Tour season 1 championship. (Luske finished in 14th place in the same tournament, earning $26,664.)
Luske formed the ''Circle of Outlaws'' group, which promotes young poker players.
In the beginning of 2007, Luske started a TV show called ''Veronica Poker'' together with Noah Boeken, in which they taught Dutch celebrities to play poker. Eventually the celebrities had to go up against each other and the winner was invited to a major tournament in Las Vegas. He also appeared in the show Poker Kings NL in which Boeken and Luske attended tournaments while followed by a camera. Later he appeared in the show Celebrity Poker on Tien television channel.
