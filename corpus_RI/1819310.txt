 The company was subsequently moved to the Isle of Man, a British Crown dependency. The move was driven by the establishment of a 0% corporate tax rate and the removal of rules barring companies from accepting casino and poker bets from America. PokerStars holds its license with the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission, and is also licensed in Italy by the Amministrazione Autonoma dei Monopoli di Stato (AAMS).  
Since relocating, PokerStars has been the subject of financial media speculation regarding a possible initial public offering or merger with a publicly listed company. Analysts estimated its market value would have been approximately $2 billion (US) in 2004, which would have made the company one of the world's largest privately held gambling companies. Now, in 2009 and into 2010 PokerStars earns approximately $1.4 billion per year, and nets $1.34 million per day.  PokerStars overtook PartyPoker as the world's largest online poker room at around the time the U.S. Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. Many sites, including PartyPoker, immediately suspended business with U.S. gamblers, while others, including PokerStars, did not.
On December 27, 2009, Pokerstars set the world record for the biggest online tournament. The tournament entry fee was $1, and the record number of people reached was 149,196.
The site dealt its 60 billionth hand on March 31, 2011. Pogo650 won the milestone hand winning $102,090.
On April 15, 2011, along with similar competitors' sites, Pokerstars.com was seized and shut down by U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which alleged it was in violation of federal bank fraud and money laundering laws.  The company subsequently stopped allowing players from the United States to play real money games and temporarily moved the main company website to Pokerstars.eu.
On April 20, 2011, control of the Pokerstars.com domain name was returned to the company from the US Attorney's office, "to facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. players    funds held in account with the companies."

In October 2008, PokerStars launched PokerStars.it, exclusively for Italian players, which will offer real money tournaments in Euro currency in addition to the usual play money games. PokerStars now offers some ring games and tournaments on its main PokerStars.com site in euro. In March 2010, the site began allowing users to keep their real-money accounts in pounds and Canadian dollars as well as U.S. dollars and euro.
