The result was    '''delete'''. Consensus is that this family is not notable as such; all notable members have articles already. Redirected to Barack Obama to prevent drive-by recreations.   19:25, 4 June 2008 (UTC)
The only notable people in this article (Barack Obama and Michelle Obama) already have articles written about them.  Notability is not inherited.  This article is no different than previous articles such as Family of Barack Obama and Malia Obama which were deleted after extensive discussion.  All of the same arguments for deleting those articles are applicable here.     ( ) 17:00, 29 May 2008 (UTC)
