North American '''area codes 657 and 714''' are California telephone area codes which encompass northern Orange County, a portion of Los Angeles County, and portions of Chino Hills in San Bernardino County. Area code 714 was split from area code 213 as a flash-cut in 1951; area code 657 went into service as an overlay to 714 on September 23, 2008.
Cities in the 657 and 714 area codes include Tustin, Placentia, Anaheim, Buena Park, Cypress, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Orange, Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Yorba Linda, portions of La Habra, and most of Brea, and Huntington Beach.
The 714 area code once included most of Southern California, generally south and east of Los Angeles, extending to the Arizona and Nevada state lines to the east, and south as far as the Mexican border (what is now area codes 619, 760 and 909, 951 and 858). It experienced several splits, the first of which moved San Diego County, Imperial County and the desert areas of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties into area code 619 on November 6, 1982. It was again split, moving eastern Los Angeles and the Inland Empire areas of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties into area code 909 on November 14, 1992. On April 18, 1998 the southern cities of Orange County were split from 714, creating area code 949.
The two area codes now cover northern and western Orange County (except for portions of La Habra and Los Alamitos and all of Seal Beach, the far northwestern portion of Brea, and the western portions of La Palma and Huntington Beach, which have always been in the same area code as Long Beach&mdash;currently the 562 area code). This is probably because at the time those splits first occurred, while most cities in Southern California were provided primary local telephone service from what was then Pacific Bell (now AT&T), the cities listed above were served by GTE (now Verizon) which is the primary telephone provider for Long Beach. 657/714 also contains the Carbon Canyon area of Chino Hills which is in San Bernardino County.
Today, five cities "straddle" the 657/714 and 949 area codes: Costa Mesa, Irvine, Santa Ana, Tustin, and Newport Beach.
