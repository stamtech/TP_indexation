The Volvo Kalmar plant was opened in 1973 just outside Kalmar, Sweden.  The Kalmar plant was one of the most revolutionary automotive production plants in the world. Using Volvo Halifax Assembly and  Volvo Torslanda Assembly as examples the Kalmar plant also adopted the group assembly system. 
At Kalmar production was carried out on 18 ft. cable-driven carriers, the carriers were battery operated and held one single car body at a time. The carriers were designed to swivel and rotate the individual bodies so that workers could access every aspect of the car in a practical fashion.  
The teams organized themselves any way they wished and at the speed they choose. While a worker on a conventional assembly line might spend his entire shift mounting one license-plate lamp after another, every member of a Kalmar work team may work at one time or another on all parts of the electrical system   from taillights to turn signals, head lamps, horn, fuse box and part of the electronically controlled fuel-injection system. The only requirement is that every team meet its production goal for a shift. As long as cars roll out on schedule, workers are free to take coffee breaks when they please or to refresh themselves in comfortable lounges equipped with kitchens and saunas. The group assembly system operated in two ways, docked or in-line. 
Docked assembly was carried out by teams of 2-3 that covered one aspect of the car on multiple vehicles or docked where teams of 3 built   entire individual vehicles from the ground up. There were 25 production teams in total at Kalmar and every team had access to their own individual break room, workshop and sauna.   
The plant was closed in 1994.
