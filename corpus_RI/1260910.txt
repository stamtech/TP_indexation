Because of the area's aerospace legacy, the stadium has a NASA F/A-18 Hornet mounted on display at the front entrance. It is one of the premier facilities in minor league baseball. The $14.5 million facility offers luxury skyboxes, a state-of-the-art video message board, and an old-fashioned manual scoreboard. The stadium's seating capacity is listed at 6,860, but can accommodate over 7,000 fans and features slightly over 4,600 permanent full chair stadium seats. Two expansive grass berm general admission areas are available when all seats are sold out to make a perfect setting for families to stretch out with a blanket and take in a ballgame.
The stadium is also used to accommodate special events such as local high school graduations and charity softball games. Before the Lancaster JetHawks start their new season in April, they play an exhibition game against the local Antelope Valley College Marauders baseball team.
On December 19, 2010, Ballpark Digest.com reported that the Lancaster JetHawks are expected to save some green -- to the tune of $48K -- this coming season after the installation of solar panels on a ballpark carport will supply 98 percent of Clear Channel Stadium's electricity needs on a typical game night. The installation is part of a city-wide emphasis on solar energy from civic structures. At the ballpark, 1,500 solar panels will be installed on a -long carport beside the ballpark, well outside of foul-ball range. The electricity generated by the 340-kilowatt panel system will supply 98 percent of the power needed to run the ballpark, including the ballpark lights, and should save the owners of the JetHawks some $48,000 per year in utility costs.    The entire Lancaster community has embraced the city   s mission to become the alternative energy capitol of the world, and as the first minor league team in California to go solar, we   re happy to do our part,    said JetHawks owner Peter Carfagna.
