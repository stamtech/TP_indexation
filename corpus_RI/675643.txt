In terms of distribution Ouyangs have mostly been confined to southern China, especially the areas of southern Jiangxi, central Hubei and eastern Henan, with smaller pockets in Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan and Guangxi.
Daling (      ), near Zhongshan City in Guangdong, China has been documented of having extensive History of Owyang, family records and family trees have been created and distributed to family members around the globe, commonly known as the Owyang Genealogy Book (hardbound, blue cover).
The most prominent of the Ouyang clans historically was undoubtedly that of Yongfeng (      ) in Jiangxi, which produced a number of scholars who reached prominence in the imperial bureaucracy. Genealogical lineages and family trees have been established for a number of Ouyang clans around China, showing migration patterns from the Song to the Qing Dynasty.
There was a large immigration of Ouyang's in the late 19th century and early 20th century to the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento Delta Area. In summer of 2005, the first extended Ouyang family reunion was held in Locke, near Sacramento. Over 200 Ouyangs attended and included speeches, sharing, family trees and documentation. This group continues to communicate using Ouyang Yahoo! Groups and spans members from across North America and beyond.
