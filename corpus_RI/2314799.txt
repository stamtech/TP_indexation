Mitchell was born in Muthill, Perthshire, Scotland on October 22, 1766 and moved to Savannah to settle the affairs of his  late uncle. He later moved to Mount Nebo Plantation, near Milledgeville, Georgia.
Mitchell served two consecutive two-year terms as the 27th Governor of Georgia (1809- 1813) and a third non-consecutive term from 1815 to 1817 thus being the last governor of Georgia born outside the United States .
Prior to his first term as governor, Mitchell was the Attorney General of Georgia (1796 -1806) and served three terms in the Georgia General Assembly, two as a representative and one in the Senate.
Mitchell resigned from his third term as governor to become President James Monroe's appointee as the U.S. agent to the Creek Indians.  One of Mitchell's responsibilities during this time was the negotiation of the Treaty of the Creek Agency (1818).
Mitchell served as the inferior court judge of Baldwin County, Georgia beginning in 1828. He was later elected as Baldwin County's State Senator in 1836.
Fort Mitchell National Cemetery (formerly the old post cemetery at Fort Mitchell) opened in 1987 in Phenix City, Alabama. The original fort was named after George Mitchell and was built by the Georgia Militia in 1813 on land that was personally donated by Mitchell.
Mitchell died at his home in Milledgeville, Mount Nebo Plantation on April 22, 1837 and is buried at Memory Hill Cemetery of the same city.
