However, in a few cases, a few services have route numbers that have no connection to their daytime equivalents, such as the N5, which operates in a different part of London from day route 5.
There are also many 24-hour routes.
Fares for night buses in London were in the past greater than fares of day time buses, and bus passes could not be used on night buses. Today, however, the fares of night buses are identical to day time buses, and any bus pass or travel card that can be used on day time buses can also be used on night time buses, as can the Oyster Card.
Route N1 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, United Kingdom. The service is currently contracted to Go-Ahead London.
Route N2 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, United Kingdom. The service is currently contracted to Arriva London.
Night bus N2 provides the night service for routes 2 (between Victoria & West Norwood) and 432 (between West Norwood & Crystal Palace) continues from Victoria, to Trafalgar Square via Victoria Street, Parliament Square and Whitehall.
The route started on the night of 13 April 1984 running between Trafalgar Square and West Norwood Station using Daimler buses, run from Victoria Garage (GM), which were replaced by Metrobuses later that year. The route was extended into North London on 27 October 1984 to Friern Barnet and to Crystal Palace in the south. A Holloway Garage single bus allocation was added to the two bus allocation at GM. The Victoria allocation was reduced to Saturday night only, with Holloway and Muswell Hill Garages sharing the main route from September 1987. The Holloway and Muswell Hill allocation lasted until August 1990, when it was replaced by Finchley Garage, and Holloway reduced to Saturday Nights only, replacing Victoria Garage. Buses were then extended from Frien Barnet to North Finchley for garage journeys, and all journeys by 18 August 1992. Finchley Garage was closed and the whole allocation moved to Holloway on 4 December 1993.
A further route change took place on 23 June 1995 when the section between North Finchley and Camden Town was withdrawn, with the route divering at Camden Town to terminate at Hampstead Heath which replaced the withdrawn route N93. This section was withdrawn on 27 November 1999, being replaced by a night service on route 24, and the route once again ran from Trafalgar Square now to Crystal Palace.
The route passed from Metroline to Arriva on 1 April 2000, running from Norwood Garage using Leyland Olympians from the day route 2, being converted to low floor operation with the day route to Volvo B7TL Alexander ALX400s (VLAs) in 2003.
Night bus N5 is a special night service for the Northern Line (Edgware Branch) between Charing Cross Station and Edgware Station, although was diverted away from Brent Cross Station on 24 January 1994 to run via Brent Street instead. Night bus N20 covers the High Barnet Branch.
The route began on 28 October 1989 running from Edgware serving all Northern Line stations to Charing Cross and then via the Strand to terminate at the Aldwych. Some journeys diverted via Whitehall and Westminster to Victoria Station. (Returning via Victoria Embankment and Arundel Street before continuing from Aldwych). The section between Aldwych and Trafalgar Square (Charing Cross) was withdrawn on 18 July 1992 and the journeys to Victoria were withdrawn on 24 June 1995.
The route was initially run from Holloway Bus Garage using Metrobuses before being converted to low floor operation using Volvo B7TL Plaxton Presidents (VPLs) during 2001. An Edgware Garage allocation was introduced during August 2003, initially with 3 buses but increasing its share until 2007 when Holloway's weeknight allocation was withdrawn.

Night bus N7 is the night service for route 7, it replaced the night service of route 23 (N23) between Northolt and Ladbroke Grove on 30 August 2003, running between Northolt and Russell Square.
Operation transferred from First (Alperton Garage) to Metroline on the night of the 23 June 2007. Metroline's new buses (Scania N230UD/Olympus) had not been delivered by the start date, so spare buses from the day routes 297 and 460 were used until the new buses arrived in late July 2007.
Night bus N9 is the night service for route 9 between Hammersmith and Aldwych, it then continues from Hammersmith to Heathrow Airport via Hounslow, Brentford, Turnham Green and Chiswick. It started in 1994 replacing the routes N65 and N92.
The N9 used to run to and from Kingston via Putney, Putney Heath and Roehampton. It was rerouted to Heathrow Airport in 29 September 2001 replacing the withdrawn section of route N97 between Hammersmith and Heathrow. Route N10 replaced the section of the N9 to Putney and route 85 replaced the section from Putney to Kingston, but the section between Richmond and Kingston was replaced by route 65, a 24-hour service.
Night bus N9 was extended from Heathrow Central to Heathrow Terminal 5 on 22 March 2008.
The route N11 started on 13 April 1984 running between Shepherds Bush Green and Liverpool Street, using two Daimler Fleetlines from Victoria Garage, these were changed to Metrobuses in July of that year. The following year, on 27 April 1985, the route was extended at both ends running between Acton Town and Hackney Central, with an increased pvr to three buses. A further extension, on the eastern end of the route, took place on 2 November from Hackney Central to Hackney Wick.
The N11 was rerouted away from Shepherd Bush to serve Turnham Green on 9 August 1986. On 28 October 1989, the allocation was split between Victoria and Shepherds Bush Garages, with one Metrobus from each, and also withdrawn between Trafalgar Square and Hackney Wick, replaced by a new route N6. The Shepherds Bush allocation was replaced with a Hounslow Garage allocation during March 1993. On the closure of Victoria Garage, during July 1993, the allocation transferred to Stockwell Garage.
The route was withdrawn from Turnham Green and returned to terminating at Shepherds Bush Green, on 26 February 1994, and also extended from Trafalgar Square back to Liverpool Street Station, and rerouted as per the day route. The complete allocation was moved to Stamford Brook and transferred to Houslow once again during 1996. The allocation moved to Shepherds Bush during 1999. The route was converted to single deck in April 2000, but reverted to double deck in March 2001. The route was diverted at Hammersmith, away from Shepherds Bush, to Wembley Central on 31 March 2001.
London General gained the contract from London United on 29 June 2003, and the route transferred to Stockwell Garage, using WVLs from the day route.
On 7 June 2008, the route was diverted at West Ealing to run via route 207 to terminate at Ealing Broadway, with route 297 being converted into a 24-hour service to replace the withdrawn section between Wembley Central and Argyle Road ''Cleveland Road''.
Night bus N13 is the night service for routes 13 and 82 between North Finchley and Aldwych. The N13 started on 13 April 1984 running via the day route 13 between Trafalgar Square and North Finchley, from Finchley Garage using Metrobuses. A few months later on 27 October the route was extended from North Finchley to Barnet Church, via the current route 263. On 18 July 1992 the route was extended in Central London to Victoria Station, running via Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Westminster.
A further extension on the northern end of the route took place on 4 December 1993 when the route was transferred to Potters Bar Garage, on the closure of Finchley, and extended to Potters Bar, via Hadley Highstone, on garage journeys. A route restructing took place on 23 June 1995 when the route was transferred to Holloway Garage, being withdrawn between Potters Bar and North Finchley, and between Victoria and Trafalgar Square.
In 2001, on 1 September, the Night Route was transferred from Metroline to London Sovereign's Edgware Garage along with some late evening and early morning journeys on the day 13, when London Sovereign gained the full contract for route 13. The route was also extended from Trafalgar Square to Aldwych to follow the day route at the same time. London Sovereign's service on the N13 initially used a mixture of Volvo Olympians and Volvo B7TL 10.6m / Plaxton Presidents, from the day routes 114 and 183. When the day route 13 was converted from Routemaster operation, on 22 October 2005, the new Scania OmniDekkas were also used on the Night route.
Night bus N16 is night service for route 16 between Cricklewood & Victoria and route 32 between Edgware & Kilburn High Road.
This night route dates back at least as far as 1934, when it was numbered 294, running between Cricklewood Bus Garage and Liverpool Street station, via Marble Arch, Oxford Circus and Trafalgar Square. The route originally ran from Cricklewood Bus Garage using AEC Renown LT type double deckers. The route was then renumbered N94 in September 1960 and renumbered again to the present N16 in 1991. By 1991, the route had been extended from Cricklewood to Edgware, and was running from Edgware Bus Garage using Metrobuses, reverting to Cricklewood Bus Garage in March 1993, only for the allocation to return back to Edgware Garage in January 1994.
On 29 January 1994 the Trafalgar Square to Liverpool Street section was withdrawn, and the rerouted from Trafalagar Square, down Whitehall to Victoria. In February 2001, the allocation was adjusted to be shared between Edgware and Cricklewood Bus Garages, again the Cricklewood allocation was withdrawn in October 2002.
At the same time, on 12 October, the route was rerouted away from Trafalgar Square to run direct from Marble Arch via Park Lane to Victoria, following the day route 16. In February 2005 an unusual one bus Harrow Weald Garage weekend allocation was introducted, shared with the existing Edgware allocation.
N18 runs the night service for routes 18 and 182. Buses run every 15 minutes (10 minutes at weekends) from Trafalgar Square to Euston Road where they then follow the day route 18 to Sudbury. Every other bus (1 in 3 buses at weekends) runs beyond Sudbury to Harrow Weald Bus Garage via route 182.
Once running via Paddington, Edgware Road and Oxford Street, in 2003 the N18 was rerouted via Marylebone Road, Great Portland Street and runs across Oxford Street, instead of through it.
The N18 had always been based at the Westbourne Park garage on a contract to First London, using double deckers (the day route 18 is operated with bendy buses). But in June 2007, route N7 was lost to Metroline which created space at Alperton Bus Garage, so route N18 (with a higher PVR) swapped garages with route N10.  
On 13 November 2010, route N18 was transferred to Willesden Junction Garage when route 18 was converted to double deckers.
Route N20, like route N5, is a special night service for the Northern Line between Charing Cross and High Barnet Stations (except it does not directly serve Totteridge & Whetstone, Woodside Park, Mill Hill East or West Finchley Stations).
The route was initially numbered N1 and began operating on the morning of the 28 October 1989 running from High Barnet to Charing Cross and then via the Strand to terminate at the Aldwych. Some journeys diverted via Whitehall and Westminster to Victoria Station. (Returning via Victoria Embankment and Arundel Street before continuing from Aldwych). The section between Aldwych and Trafalgar Square (Charing Cross) was withdrawn on 18 July 1992. The journeys to Victoria were withdrawn on 24 June 1995, when the route was renumbered N20, as the number N1 was needed for the night service of the day route 1.
The route was initially run from Holloway Bus Garage using Metrobuses, until 24 June 1995 when a single bus Potters Bar allocation was introduced. The weekend service was increased in 1997 and the allocations were increased. On 15 July 1998 the route was transferred to Northumberland Park bus garage to be operated by First Capital using Leyland Olympians. On 8 January 2000 extra Friday/Saturday night journeys were added between Trafalgar Square and Finchley Central. After 5 years with First, on 25 August 2003, the route transferred back to Potters Bar with Metroline, and the extra journeys were extended from Finchley Central to High Barnet. The route returned to Holloway Garage during February 2005, when a weekend night allocation was introduced.
Night Bus Route N21 is the night service for route 21 between Bank and Lewisham, and - until 10/10/09 - for route 233 between Eltham and Foots Cray, for route 51 between Blackfen and Foots Cray and for route 321 between New Cross Gate and Eltham and Sidcup (Police Station) and Foots Cray.
The N21 was introduced to provide a night service over the original route 21 between Central London and Sidcup (Foots Cray), but with a deviation via Avery Hill and Blackfen, to serve the University of Greenwich, which provides the route with steady patronage between there and Central London (not just at weekends either). It originally operated from Victoria to Foots Cray via its current routing but on Friday and Saturday Nights some journeys ran via New Eltham and Mottingham, terminating at Sidcup. In 1999 the route was re-structured again with the extra weekend journeys via New Eltham being revised to operate from Eltham to Chislehurst via Mottingham and was introduced to run every night (not just weekends). The original service to Foots Cray via Blackfen and Sidcup remained unchanged. Changes to the frequency meant buses running every 30 minutes between Victoria and Eltham then every 60 mins to Chislehurst and Foots Cray respectively.
In 2002 another re-structure saw the Chislehurst Journeys withdrawn and run through to Foots Cray. Instead, providing a 30 min service over the whole route. The route was also shortened to start and terminate at Trafalgar Square as opposed to Victoria. On Friday and Saturday nights, patronage was such that extras were introduced between Eltham High Street and Trafalgar Square, combined with the Foots Cray Buses providing a 15-minute service over that section of route. With the withdrawal of the Chislehurst Services, Mottingham and Chislehurst were without a night bus route until Feb 2008 when the N136 was introduced (replacing parts of the N36).
The route was further amended on 10 October 2009, being withdrawn between Blackfen and Sidcup, instead running to Bexleyheath via Blendon, Bridgen and Old Bexley along the established day route 132. The Night service to Sidcup was simultaneously replaced by a 24-hour service on route 321, restoring a night service to New Eltham after an absence of 10 years.
Operation is still shared between London Central's Bexleyheath and New Cross Garages. Until Recently Bexleyheath Garage allocated 2 ADL Enviro-400 Tridents (E Class) from the route 486 allocation on the N21, now the BX allocation is predominantly 2 Volvo B9TL Wright Gemini 2 (WVL Class), since a bacth of 35 arrived for routes 229 and 422 in early 2011. This Standardises the allocation with New Cross' 3 Volvo B9TL Wright Gemini 2 (WVL Class) from the route 21 allocation. Both Garages can also allocate Volvo B7TL Plaxton Presidents should the need arise.
Route N22 has previously run beyond Fulwell to Kingston, however this was withdrawn on 3 June 2006 when route 281 became a 24-hour service.
From 25 June 2011, First London will operate route N26 having successfully gained the contract for the service.
Night bus N28 runs the night service for route 28 between Wandsworth & Harrow Road. Route N28, together with route N31, run the night service for 31 between Notting Hill Gate & Camden Town Station.
The route started out on the night of the 29 May 1999 as single-deck route, but was converted, along with the day routes, to double-deck using brand new Volvo B7TL 10m / Wright Eclipse Gemini in late 2004.
Night bus N31 shares the night service with N28 for routes 28, 31 and 328.
Night bus N38 provides a night service for route 38, between Victoria and Clapton Pond and then continue to Walthamstow Central.
In 2005 N41 was extended from Archway via Holloway Road, Angel, and Holborn to Trafalgar Square, replacing the withdrawn N43.
Night Bus Route N52 began operation on 4 December 1993 introducing a night service for route 52 between Victoria & Willesden - but unlike the day route, the night version runs via Parliament Square, Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus (instead of Grosvenor Place as per the day route). Initially running with Leyland Titans, and after a short period of Volvo Olympians, the route was converted to low floor using Volvo B7TL/Plaxton Presidents in 2001.
Night bus N55 is the night service for day routes 55 (between Oxford Circus and Leyton ''Bakers Arms''), 257 (between Leyton ''Baker Arms'' and Leytonstone ''Green Man'') and W13 (between Leytonstone ''Green Man'' and Woodford Wells).
On 28 August 2010, the N64 was introduced to replace the withdrawn N159 from New Addington to Addington Village and to Thornton Heath via 64.
Night bus N74 is a night service for routes 74 between Baker Street and Putney High Street and 430 between South Kensington and Roehampton ''Danebury Avenue''.
Route N74 replaced the night service of route 14 (N14) between Roehampton and Putney Bridge on 31 January 2003.
Night bus N87 is the night service for route 87 between Aldwych & Wandsworth and route 156 between Wandsworth & Wimbledon, it then continues to Kingston via Raynes Park & New Malden via route 131.
On 3 June 2006 route N77 was renumbered N87, along with the renumbering of the day route from 77A to 87. Route N87 was withdrawn between Kingston and Tolworth at the same time and replaced by route 281 which became a 24-hour service.
The N89 was Introduced in 2003 when it replaced the N81 that ran between Victoria Station and Bexleyheath. Throughout its existence as a South East London Night Route, the N81 had Many Projections and Diversions, at one stage running as far as Dartford and Gillingham. The Route was then Curtailed to Crayford for a short period of time before finally being cut back further to Bexleyheath. The N81 Generally followed the same Routeing between Victoria and Bexleyheath, despite the changes. The N81 was replaced in 2003 by the N89. The N89 runs from Trafalgar Square over most of the old N81 routing to Bexleyheath and was extended onwards to Erith via Slade Green, over the then 89 and 469 route's. The Erith Extension was introduced to prevent idling buses causing a nuisance to Slade Green residents, as well as providing a 'useful' connection. Between Lewisham and Slade Green the N89 matched the daytime 89 route, so the renumbering from N81 to N89 reflected this. The Erith extension also enabled route N53 to be curtailed at Plumstead, later to be replaced by the 53 becoming a 24 hour service between Plumstead and Whitehall only. The Thamesmead services on the N53 were replaced by an extension of the N1 Service. With the Loss of the N53 Between Plumstead and Erith, Lesnes Heath and Upper Belvedere areas became deprived of a night bus Service, whereby other nearby areas of Northumberland Heath, North End and Slade Green, all previously never served by Night Services, gained a Night Bus Service with the introduction of the N89.
The N89 is London's longest night bus route at 34&nbsp;km (21.12 Miles) long, closely followed by the N9 at 33&nbsp;km (20.50 Miles) Long. 
From its inception the route ran every 30 minutes every night, until September 2010 when the frequency at weekends (Fri and Sat Nights) was increased to every 20 minutes to meet the higher demand placed on the service at these times. Since February 2011, the vehicle allocation has been predominantly Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Geminis since a batch of 35 arrived for routes 229 and 422. As part of the TFL tendering system the N89 and its daytime counterpart the 89 were recently re-tendered, London Central being successful in retaining both routes for another 5 years and will be gaining new Alexander Dennis Enviro400. 
Route N91 is the night service for route 91 between Trafalgar Square & Crouch End and the Piccadilly Line between Holborn & Cockfosters.
The N91 is also the night replacement bus for the Piccadilly Line between Cockfosters & Holborn Stations (albeit not serving Holloway Road, Arsenal, Finsbury Park, and Manor House stations). Passengers can then continue their journey using night routes N97 to Hammersmith and N9 to Heathrow Airport Central.
Night Bus Route N97 has the distinction of being the shortest dedicated Night Bus Route at only 6 miles long. However, the route began as the 297 in October 1934 (itself being renumbered from route 614) and ran between Liverpool Street and Turnham Green. It was renumbered as N97 in 1960 and was later extended westward to Heathrow Central via Brentford,  Isleworth, Hounslow and Cranford. There is no day counterpart to the route, and to travel along this route during the day from Hammersmith one would need to take route 190 to West Brompton, route 74 to  Hyde Park Corner and route 9 to Trafalgar Square.
The route is primarily used as a night replacement for the Piccadilly Line between Piccadilly Circus and Hammersmith Stations. Passengers can then continue their journey using night routes N91 (to Cockfosters) or N9 (to Heathrow).
Night bus N98 runs a night service for route 98 between Holborn and Willesden, and then continues to Stanmore via Kingsbury and Neasden as a night service for the Northern end of the Jubilee Line. The route is structured so that every other bus runs beyond Willesden to Stanmore.
The N98 use run to Trafalgar Square, in the days when all night routes were centered around Trafalgar Square, via Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus, but the Trafalgar Square to Oxford Circus section was withdrawn in 2003, with no replacement, and instead rerouted to Holborn ''Red Lion Square''.
The route was also on a contract to Centrewest, stationed at Alperton bus garage, using Leyland Olympians and Metrobuses. The allocation was moved to Metroline in 2003, to Willesden and Edgware garages, using Volvo B7TL / Plaxton Presidents.
On 28 August 2010, The N109 was introduced to replace the discontinued N159 between Oxford Circus and Croydon and will run every 20 minutes.
Night bus N136 is the night service for routes 36, 136 and 436 between Victoria & Grove Park. It was commenced on 9 February 2008 to replace the discontinued night bus N36 and route 36 was converted into a 24-hour service.
Night bus N207 is the night service for the 207, 427 and 607 between Uxbridge and Shepherd's Bush and then continues to Holborn ''Red Lion Square''. The route runs every 15 minutes (10 minutes weekends) between Holborn and Hayes by-pass, and every 30 between Hayes by-pass and Uxbridge.
N207 replaced the former night bus N89, which ran from Uxbridge Station to Victoria Station, in 2001. It was then rerouted to Aldwych, and in 2005 it was rerouted again to Holborn. Night bus N207's Acton allocation was transferred to Hayes in March 2008. On 29 May 2010 route N207 was temporarily withdrawn between Holborn to Oxford Circus. 
Night bus N279 is the night service for route 279 between Waltham Cross and Manor House Station, it then continues to Trafalgar Square via Holloway, Camden, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square. It previously continued to Victoria. Back in 1998, there were journeys continuing out into the countryside to Upshire.
It once ran via St Pancras, King's Cross & Euston but due to Pancras Road being a one way system it was rerouted via Eversholt Street and Hampstead Road in 2006.
Route N551 was introduced on 30 October 2008 alongside route N550 replacing route N50.
