In addition to unusual, experimental, and/or noise music, many festival performers use film, multimedia, and spoken word. Yahoo News in 2007 called it a "summer festival to watch". In ''Signum'', writer Tiffany Lee Brown commented in 2001: "This was no overpriced, fancypants event full of goatee-stroking theorizers or a showcase of overserious minimalist compositions, but a romp through the tangled underbrush of homegrown experimentalism."
