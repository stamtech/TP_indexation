Ferguson was born in Los Angeles, California. Both Ferguson's parents have doctoral degrees in mathematics and his father, Thomas Ferguson, teaches game theory and theoretical probability at UCLA.
Ferguson attended UCLA where he earned a Ph.D. in computer science (focusing on virtual network algorithms) in 1999  after five years as an undergraduate and 13 years as a graduate student. His Ph.D. advisor was Leonard Kleinrock.
Ferguson was playing poker by the age 10.  In college he honed his skill on IRC playing poker for play money in chat rooms.  In 1994, he began playing in tournaments in California and in 1995, he entered his first World Series of Poker.  Ferguson beat T. J. Cloutier at the main event of the 2000 WSOP to win the $1.5 million prize. In 2004, he entered the WSOP main event, earning $120,000 for his 26th place finish (out of 2,576 players).  Also in 2004, Ferguson helped launch the online poker site Full Tilt Poker. Alec Wilkinson, The Sporting Scene, The New Yorker, March 30, 2009
Ferguson finished runner-up to Phil Hellmuth in the 2005 National Heads-Up Poker Championship. He made the finals again in 2006, but again finished second, this time to Ted Forrest. In 2008 he made the finals for the third time, this time defeating Andy Bloch and winning the title.  He once had the most wins in the event over its six-year lifespan, but is now second to Huck Seed.
In 2008, Ferguson cashed for US$677,905 at the WSOP, a number that greatly exceeded his 2007 WSOP cash total of $84,562. As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $8,000,000.  His 63 WSOP cashes account for $4,051,104 of those winnings and put him third for most cashes at the WSOP, behind Phil Hellmuth and Men Nguyen.
He claims to have turned $1 into more than $20,000 playing online poker over six months as a personal challenge. He talked about this as a guest on ''Poker Night Live''. Similarly, to show that it could be done, he turned $0 into $10,000 on Full Tilt by first winning freeroll tournaments. Despite achieving his goal, Ferguson has continued the challenge and was at one point over $20,000. He has developed an algorithm for deal making for players who reach the final table in Full Tilt Poker's online tournaments.
He is a relatively quiet player who often adopts a characteristic motionless pose to avoid providing information to his opponents. He adopted his trademark wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses consciously, trying to disguise the fact that he was a college student. 
His style is highly mathematical, using a strong knowledge of game theory and developing computer simulations to improve his understanding of the game.
Ferguson is nicknamed "Jesus" because of his trademark long brown hair and beard.
In addition to these bracelets, Ferguson is the only player to have won three World Series of Poker circuit events.
His interests include his presidency of a swing dancing club at UCLA, as well as his ability to throw playing cards fast enough to cut through bananas, carrots, and even melons.
