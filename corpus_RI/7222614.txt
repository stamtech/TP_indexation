A global non-scientific Internet vote conducted by ''The Economist'', with 52,000 respondents, indicated that Obama was favored over McCain by a vast majority of poll respondents, with over 44,000 votes, or roughly 85%, for Obama (there was no abstain option).
In a poll conducted in 22 countries for the BBC World Service in July and August 2008, those in all 22 countries preferred Obama. The margin in favor of Obama ranged from 9% in India to 82% in Kenya. On average, 49% of respondents preferred Barack Obama and 12% preferred John McCain, while nearly 40% expressed no preference.
Media around the world reacted with strong emotions when Obama was elected. Most expressed positive hopes and expecations for the president-elect, but some tried to prepare their readers for disappointment. Editorials varied from elation  to cautious optimism, and a few were outright skeptical. Many celebrated Obama's victory as historic and a sign of changing race-relations in America. Commentators said the election results surprised them because there was an international perception that America was too racist to elect a black president. Many also said people in their country were blinded by infatuation with Obama and encouraged them to see him as a normal human being capable of error. Within a week, the excitement and elation subsided somewhat and newspaper editorials began to caution that Obama had enormous obstacles ahead. 
The election was closely watched from around the world and domestic media like ''CNN'' and ''PBS'' tracked the international reaction. Major newspapers on every continent covered the election's outcome on their front pages or as their top story, a reflection of the U.S.'s strong influence on world affairs and candidate Obama's international celebrity. Obama's campaign had said it would like to "build a fan base across the world."
