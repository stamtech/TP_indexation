Proctor is a former country musician who began his music career as a guitarist in his hometown of Arlington, Texas in 1973.  He worked as a studio and touring musician, most notably as keyboardist in Clay Walker's live band in the mid-1990s.  As a solo artist, Proctor charted four singles on the ''Billboard'' Country chart between 1986 and 1988, the highest of which, ''Ain't We Got Love'' peaked at #62.
Proctor states that he returned to the Baptist faith of his youth in the spring of 1995, resuming his attendance at First Baptist Church of Franklin, Tennessee, after 10 years away.  Within a few years, though, Proctor left First Baptist over a disagreement with his pastor on a number of issues, including the renaming of the church - which eliminated the word "Baptist" from its name  - and a new contemporary style of worship that was implemented.  
In his columns, he often quotes the King James Version of the Bible at length.  He is highly opposed to "church growth" techniques, especially the "Purpose Driven" philosophy advocated by Rick Warren.  Still, many even in Reformed circles have found Proctor's theology to be spotty.
In late 2005 Kyle Lake, pastor of University Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, was electrocuted and died in the baptistry after a hot water heater malfunctioned.  In a column about the incident titled "God Sends Shocking Message to the Emerging Church," Proctor suggested that God killed Lake in order to get the attention of churches that he considered to be straying from biblical principles.
While claiming to have little interest in politics, Proctor is very critical of President George W. Bush and skeptical of Bush's religious faith.  He also criticizes Christians who support Bush, and wrote favorably of Constitution Party candidate Michael Peroutka in the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election.
