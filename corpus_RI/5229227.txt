Currently, most New England Motor Freight tractors are governed to a speed of . Tractors consist of Ford, International, Mack, and Volvo, both single axle and twin screw, sleeper cabs and day cabs. The tractors consist of both automatic and manual transmissions. Most newer tractors are either Mack or Volvo.
Linehaul drivers work night shifts driving from terminal to terminal. Pick-up and Delivery (P&D) drivers work day shifts and deliver locally from their terminal. Daycab tractors are shared by linehaul and P&D drivers, this is called slip-seating. While sleeper cabs are usually assigned to only one driver. Linehaul drivers will sometimes layover at other terminals at the end of their shift and then return to their home terminal the next day. Some linehaul drivers are on "bid" runs, which is a set run evey night. However their run can be changed as deemed necessary but is usually consistent. Some bid runs are "turns" which the driver returns to his or her home terminal everyday.
