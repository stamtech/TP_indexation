  Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979.  Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament "more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire."  Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event. 
One of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure.  The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool.  The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure.  In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third.  This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.
The 1990 SBOP had arguably one of the toughest final tables ever assembled.  Four of the final six players (Jack Keller, Stu Ungar, T.J. Cloutier, and Chip Reese) have all been inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.  A fifth player, Hamid Dastmalchi won the WSOP Main Event in 1992.  Between the five of them, they have acquired 20 WSOP bracelets.  T.J. Cloutier did at the SBOP what he has failed to do at the WSOP, despite making 4 WSOP Main Event Final tables, by winning the SBOP Main Event.  Billy Baxter won the Deuce To Seven Lowball.  Deuce to Seven is the format type where Baxter has won five WSOP bracelets.  Baxter had finished in second place in various SBOP Deuce to Seven Lowball five times and third once.
Hoyt Corkins a two time bracelet and one time World Poker Tour winner won his first major tournament at the 1990 SBOP.
