The '''Chicago Center for Green Technology''' is a green building with Platinum LEED status, which offers educational tours on daily basis. There are also community workshops put on by the center, which give examples of how environmentally friendly technology can be incorporated into residential homes.
The original building was built in 1952.http://egov.cityofchicago.org/city/webportal/portalContentItemAction.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@1561492671.1243911612@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccceadehglieehicefecelldffhdfhm.0&contentOID=536929700&contenTypeName=COC_EDITORIAL&topChannelName=SubAgency&entityName=Chicago+Center+for+Green+Technology&deptMainCategoryOID=-536894561&blockName=Environment/Chicago+Center+for+Green+Technology/Content&context=dept When the Sacramento Crushing Company owned the property they collected and dumped 600,000 cubic yards of construction and demolition debris on the  property. After discovering what was going on, the Chicago Department of Environment (DOE) claimed that the company was illegally running a solid waste storage and treatment facility and took them to court. The Chicago DOE successfully fought Sacramento Crushing in court and reclaimed the land and the building in 1996., Retrieved on May 30, 2009. The city of Chicago then spent $9 million to clean up the property before a renovation of the original building could begin.
Renovation of the . building cost a total of $5.4 million and lasted from 1999 to 2003http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/mixedmode/ccgt.html, at which point it was opened to the public. Before the formal design process began, it was decided that the main goal of the renovation was going to be that the building had to pass the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED Platinum rating, which is the highest LEED rating a building can get. The goal to have the building be LEED Platinum certified was the determining factor in all building decisions, such as mechanical, electrical, and ventilation systems. All aspects of the building were optimized in order to reduce waste during the construction process, and energy waste during the operation of the building once it was completely renovated.
The Chicago Center for Green Technology uses about 40% less energy than a building of the same size due to the multiple ways it gathers and conserves its energy. Solar panels on the roof, on awnings around the building, and an array of solar panels in a lot behind the building provide 20% of the building's energy.http://www.epa.gov/region4/brownfieldstoolkit/casestudies/csnatlCgreenb.pdf Passive heating is provided by large double-paned and insulated glass windows that also provide large amounts of light. Another source of heat or air-conditioning, depending on what season it is, comes from 28 vertical wells beneath the building that go to a depth of 200 feet, at which point the temperature is relatively constant. Water is pumped down the wells and then extracted, which helps cool the building in the summer and heat it in the winter. A smart lighting system throughout the building detects the amount of natural light and adjusts the amount of light provided by electricity. Scrap cork flooring and recycled glass bathroom tiles make up part of the building materials, which come from more than 40% recycled material. The Center for Green Technology has a green roof, which consists of  of soil and plant matter. The green roof helps to absorb rainwater and insulate the building. Rainwater is released from downspouts into the soil, as opposed to the public sewer system, in order to reduce the amount of run-off contaminants in the sewers. The landscaping around the building is irrigated with rain water that is stored in cisterns, which helps reduce the amount of treated water from the city.
A few of Chicago   s most environmentally friendly businesses operate out of the Chicago Center for Green Technology. Chicago Department of Environment   s Greencorps Chicago Program is located at CCGT. The Greencorps program is a community landscaping and job training program, which provides instruction, workshops, and assistance for anyone in Chicago that wants to develop a garden site or improve the natural environment in Chicago.
