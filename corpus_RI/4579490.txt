The second generation of the Soyuz spacecraft, the '''Soyuz Ferry''' or '''''Soyuz 7K-T''''', comprised Soyuz 12 through Soyuz 40 (1973-1981). Although still using the ''Igla'' system, these had no solar panels, employing batteries. The replacement of solar panels with batteries limited it to about two days of undocked flight.
A modified version of this spacecraft flew on Soyuz 13, where instead of the docking system a large Orion 2 astrophysical camera for imaging the sky and Earth was used.
Another modification was the ''Soyuz 7K-T/A9'' used for the flights to the military Almaz space station. This featured the ability to remote control the space station and a new parachute system and other still classified and unknown changes.
