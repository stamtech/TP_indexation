CLDC is designed for devices that have limited processing power, memory, and graphical capability. Devices typically have the following features:
Compared to the Java SE environment, several APIs are absent entirely, and some APIs are altered such that code requires explicit changes to support CLDC.  In particular, certain changes aren't just the absence of classes or interfaces, but actually change the signatures of existing classes in the base class library.  An example of this is the absence of the Serializable interface, which does not appear in the base class library due to restrictions on reflection usage.  All java.lang.* classes which normally implement Serializable do not, therefore, implement this tagging interface. 
Other examples of limitations depend on the version being used, as some features were re-introduced with version 1.1 of CLDC.
A profile is a set of APIs that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the CLDC framework to provide a complete Java application environment. There are specific profiles for devices ranging from vending machines to set-top boxes, with the mobile phone profile MIDP being the most prevalent.Summary of CLDC-Based Profiles http://developers.sun.com/mobility/midp/ttips/cldc/
 (MIDP 1.0) and JSR 118JSR 118, MIDP 2.0 http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=118MIDP 2.0 API http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/ (MIDP 2.0).  Both versions provide an LCD oriented GUI API, with MIDP 2.0 including a basic 2D gaming API. Applications written to use this profile are called MIDlets. Many cell phones come with a MIDP implementation, and it is a popular platform for downloadable cell phone games.Mobile games platforms analysis (June 2009) http://www.bharatbook.com/Market-Research-Reports/New-Mobile-Games-Platforms-Challenges-and-opportunities.htmlpocketgamer.co.uk mobile platforms feature http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/feature.asp?c=1266
The '''Information Module Profile''' is specified in JSR 195JSR 195, Information Module Profile http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=195 and is designed for vending machines, network cards, routers, telephone boxes and other systems with either simple or no display and some form of limited two way network access. Only APIs for application creation, storage, and network access are defined. These are a subset of the javax.microedition.io, rms and midlet packages in MIDP. Siemens mobile and Nokia put forward this specification to the JCP.
The '''DoJa''' profile was designed for DoCoMo's i-mode mobile phone by NTT DoCoMo.
The '''Digital Set Top Box''' profile, specified in JSR 242,JSR 242, Digital Set Top Box Profile http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=242 is designed for the cable market. Also referred to as '''OnRamp''', this profile is based on a subset of the Open Cable Application Platform (OCAP), which defines a set of APIs for the development of applications for set-top boxes and similar devices. The profile consists of subsets from the CDC Personal Basis Profile including support for AWT, Xlet, file access, and network APIs, as well as several media-related interfaces from OCAP. The whole profile encompassed 31 Java packages and approximately 1500 APIs.
The PDA Optional Packages are specified in JSR-75JSR 75, PDA Optional Packages http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=75 and are designed for PDAs such as Palm or Windows CE devices.
The specification defines two independent packages that represent important features found on many PDAs and other mobile devices. These packages are:
