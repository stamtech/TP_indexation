The HELPS hurricane expo is an exposition intended to help the general public prepare for, endure through and recover from hurricanes and other natural disasters.  It is an event that is supported by both private-sector, non-profit, and government agencies who have an interest in educating the public on disaster preparedness.
HELPS is a public service event that offers free parking and free admission.  The first HELPS Expo is scheduled to be held in Orlando, Florida at the Orange County Convention Center on May 19 and May 20, 2007, but the scope of HELPS goes far beyond this with plans for more expositions throughout many coastal areas.  Immediate plans include expositions in Jacksonville and Tampa.
