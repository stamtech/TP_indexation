The '''Muckenthaler House''', now the '''Muckenthaler Cultural Center''', is located in Fullerton, California.  It is a large Spanish Colonial Revival residence that was built in 1921.
The mission of the Muckenthaler is to provide our community with experiences that stimulate creativity and imagination, and to conserve the heritage of the Muckenthaler Estate. The Muckenthaler Cultural Center provides extraordinary exhibitions, performances and stimulating educational programs to Orange County   s diverse communities and beyond. We are a celebration of the human spirit through the arts.
Commissioned at an original cost of $35,000, the Muckenthaler home was built by Walter and Adella Muckenthaler in 1924 atop a hill in Fullerton. The 18-room mansion on 8.5 acres was donated to the city in 1965 by Harold Muckenthaler, who wished to see his childhood home used as a cultural center for the public to enjoy. In 1999, the Muckenthaler received designation by the National Register of Historic Places. In its 45th year,    The Muck    now showcases more than 100 performances, gallery exhibits and classes every year, and serves more than 25,000 people. The center hosts more than 75 weddings and corporate events each year. In 2008, the center won the    Best Historic Site    and    Best Cultural Center    awards from OC Parenting magazine. In 2009,  the center won the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce    Quality of Life    award for best non-profit organization in the city. In 2010, the center won the    Best Arts Organization Award    from the county wide arts council, Arts OC.
The wrought iron staircase railing in the home   s entry was imported from Italy. The tiles that surround the fireplaces and cover the solarium floor were designed by the Ernest Batchelder Tile Company. The library and conservatory decor features period furniture including several heirloom pieces from the Muckenthaler family.
