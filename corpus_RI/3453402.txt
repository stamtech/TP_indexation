First I would like to provide some statistics for the site:
1. Searching Google ("Doodlebug") returns a number 2 result as seen here: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Doodlebug

9. Stats of the site in the passed 24 hours are as follows: Doodles added: 25, Votes cast: 2,072, Messages posted: 902
10. Samples of the artwork created can be found here: http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-12%2CGGLG%3Aen&q=doodlebug+_doodles
I think the number one question most of our members have is that Wikipedia has several websites listed in its database that are very similar to ours, for example:
Worth1000 Isketch 10eastern
Even though they are similar in the "creation of art" Doodlebug is very much one of a kind, I have yet to locate a site that mimics it. If you could clarify how our entry differs from the relevence of the other entries we would be glad to make any nessecary changes.
