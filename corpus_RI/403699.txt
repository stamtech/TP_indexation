A '''contour line''' (also '''isoline''' or '''isarithm''') of a function of two variables is a  curve along which the function has a constant value. In cartography, a contour line (often just called a "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level. A '''contour map''' is a map illustrated with contour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness of slopes. The '''contour interval''' of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.
More generally, a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve connecting points where the function has the same particular value. The gradient of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. When the lines are close together the magnitude of the gradient is large: the variation is steep. A level set is a generalization of a contour line for functions of any number of variables.
Contour lines are curved or straight lines on a map describing the intersection of a real or hypothetical surface with one or more horizontal planes. The configuration of these contours allows map readers to infer relative gradient of a parameter and estimate that parameter at specific places. Contour lines may be either traced on a visible three-dimensional model of the surface, as when a photogrammetrist viewing a stereo-model plots elevation contours, or interpolated from estimated surface elevations, as when a computer program threads contours through a network of observation points of area centroids. In the latter case, the method of interpolation affects the reliability of individual isolines and their portrayal of slope, pits and peaks.
Contour lines are often given specific names beginning "iso-" (from Greek ''        ''  (''isos''), meaning 'equal') according to the nature of the variable being mapped, although in many usages the phrase "contour line" is most commonly used. Specific names are most common in meteorology, where multiple maps with different variables may be viewed simultaneously. The prefix "iso-" can be replaced with "isallo-" to specify a contour line connecting points where a variable changes at the same ''rate'' during a given time period (also termed as ''isobar'').
The words ''isoline'' and ''isarithm'' (from ''              '' or ''arithmos'', meaning 'number') are general terms covering all types of contour line.  The word ''isogram'' (from ''            '' or ''gramma'', meaning 'something written or drawn') was proposed by Francis Galton in 1889 as a convenient generic designation for lines indicating equality of some physical condition or quantity; but it commonly refers to a word without a repeated letter.
An '''isogon''' (from ''          '' or ''gonia'', meaning 'angle') is a contour line for a variable which measures direction.  In meteorology and in geomagnetics, the term ''isogon'' has specific meanings which are described below.  An '''isocline''' (from ''               '' or ''klinein'', meaning 'to lean or slope') is a line joining points with equal slope.  In population dynamics and in geomagnetics, the terms ''isocline'' and ''isoclinic line'' have specific meanings which are described below.
In geography, the word ''isopleth'' (from ''            '' or ''plethos'', meaning 'quantity') is used for contour lines that depict a variable which cannot be measured at a point, but which instead must be calculated from data collected over an area. An example is population density, which can be calculated by dividing the population of a census district by the surface area of that district. Each calculated value is presumed to be the value of the variable at the centre of the area, and isopleths can then be drawn by a process of interpolation. The idea of an isopleth map can be compared with that of a choropleth map.
In meteorology, the word ''isopleth'' is used for any type of contour line.
Meteorological contour lines are based on generalization from point data received from weather stations. Weather stations are seldom exactly positioned at a contour line (when they are, this indicates a measurement precisely equal to the value of the contour). Instead, lines are drawn to best approximate the locations of exact values, based on the scattered information points available.
Meteorological contour maps may present collected data such as actual air pressure at a given time, or generalized data such as average pressure over a period of time, or forecast data such as predicted air pressure at some point in the future
Thermodynamic diagrams use multiple overlapping contour sets (including isobars and isotherms) to present a picture the major thermodynamic factors in a weather system.
An '''isobar''' (from ''          '' or ''baros'', meaning 'weight') is a line of equal or constant pressure on a graph, plot, or map; an isopleth or contour line of pressure.
More accurately, isobars are lines drawn on a map joining places of equal average atmospheric pressure reduced to sea level for a specified period of time. In meteorology, the barometric pressures shown are reduced to sea level, not the surface pressures at the map locations. The distribution of isobars is closely related to the magnitude and direction of the wind field, and can be used to predict future weather patterns.
Isobars are commonly used in television news weather reporting, though more commonly in Europe than in the United States.
An '''isostere''' is a line of constant atmospheric density. An '''isoheight''' or '''isohypse''' is a line of constant geopotential height on a constant pressure surface chart.
An '''isotherm''' (from ''          '' or ''therme'', meaning 'heat') is a line that connects points on a map that have the same temperature. Therefore, all points through which an isotherm passes have the same or equal temperatures at the time indicated. Generally, isotherms representing 5&nbsp;  C or 10&nbsp;  F temperature differences are used, but any interval may be chosen.
An '''isogeotherm''' is a line of equal mean annual temperature. An '''isocheim''' is a line of equal mean winter temperature, and an '''isothere''' is a line of equal mean summer temperature.
An '''isohel''' (from ''          '' or ''helios'', meaning 'sun') is a line of equal or constant solar radiation.
An '''isohyet''' or '''isohyetal line''' (from ''          '' or ''huetos'', meaning 'rain') is a line joining points of equal precipitation on a map. A map with isohyets is called an '''isohyetal map'''.
An '''isohume''' is a line of constant relative humidity, while a '''isodrosotherm''' (from ''            '' or ''drosos'', meaning 'dew', and ''          '' or ''therme'', meaning 'heat') is a line of equal or constant dew point.
An '''isoneph''' is a line indicating equal cloud cover.
An '''isochalaz''' is a line of constant frequency of hail storms, and an '''isobront''' is a line drawn through geographical points at which a given phase of thunderstorm activity occurred simultaneously.
Snow cover is frequently shown as a contour-line map.
An '''isotach''' (from ''          '' or ''tachus'', meaning 'fast') is a line of constant wind speed.
In meteorology, the term '''isogon''' (see ''Types of contour lines'' above) refers to a line of constant wind direction.
An '''isopectic''' line denotes equal dates of ice formation each winter, and an '''isotac''' denotes equal dates of thawing.
Contours are one of several common methods used to denote elevation or altitude and depth on maps. From these contours, a sense of the general terrain can be determined. They are used at a variety of scales, from large-scale engineering drawings and architectural plans, through topographic maps up to continental-scale maps.
In cartography, a '''contour interval''' is any space between contour lines, representing a difference in elevation between the lines. When calculated as a ratio against the map scale, a sense of the hilliness of the terrain can be derived.
In the study of the Earth's magnetic field, the term '''isogon''' or '''isogonic line''' (see ''Types of contour lines'' above) refers to a line of constant magnetic declination, the variation of magnetic north from geographic north. An '''agonic line''' is drawn through points of zero magnetic declination.
An '''isoclinic line''' (for ''isocline'' see ''Types of contour lines'' above) connects points of equal magnetic dip, and an '''aclinic line''' connects those where the magnetic dip is zero.
An '''isodynamic line''' (from ''              '' or ''dynamis'' meaning 'power') connects points with the same intensity of magnetic force.
Besides ocean depth, oceanographers use contour to describe diffuse variable phenomena much as meteorologists do with atmospheric phenomena. In particular, '''isobathytherms''' are lines showing depths of water with equal temperature, '''isohalines''' show lines of equal ocean salinity, and '''Isopycnals''' are surfaces of equal water density.
Various geological data are rendered as contour maps in structural geology, sedimentology, stratigraphy and economic geology. Contour maps are used to show the below ground surface of geologic strata, fault surfaces (especially low angle thrust faults) and unconformities. Isopach maps use '''isopachs''' (lines of equal thickness) to illustrate variations in thickness of geologic units.
In discussing pollution, density maps can be very useful in indicating sources and areas of greatest contamination. Contour maps are especially useful for diffuse forms or scales of pollution. Acid precipitation is indicated on maps with '''isoplats'''.  Some of the most widespread applications of environmental science contour maps involve mapping of environmental noise (where lines of equal sound pressure level are denoted '''isobels'''
An '''isoflor''' is an isopleth contour connecting areas of comparable biological diversity. Usually, the variable is the number of species of a given genus or family that occurs in a region. Isoflor maps are thus used to show distribution patterns and trends such as centres of diversity.
In economics, contour lines can be used to describe features which vary quantitatively over space. An '''isochrone''' shows lines of equivalent drive time or travel time to a given location. An '''isotim''' shows equivalent transport costs from the source of a raw material, and an '''isodapane''' shows equivalent cost of travel time.
In population dynamics, '''isocline''' (see ''Types of contour lines'' above) refers to the set of population sizes at which the rate of change, or partial derivative, for one population in a pair of interacting populations is zero.
Isolines can also be used to delineate qualitative differences. An '''isogloss''', for example, is used in mapping the geographic spread of linguistic features.
Contour lines are also used in non-geographic charts in economics. An '''isoquant''' is a line of equal production quantity, and an '''isocost''' shows equal production costs.
Various types of graphs in thermodynamics, engineering, and other sciences use isobars (for showing constant pressure), isotherms (for constant temperature), isochors (for constant specific volume), or other types of iso-lines (or curves), even though these graphs are usually not related to maps.  Such iso-lines are useful for representing more than two dimensions (or quantities) on two-dimensional graphs.  Common examples in thermodynamics are some types of phase diagrams.
In interpreting radar images, an '''isodop''' is a line of equal Doppler velocity, and an '''isoecho''' is a line of equal radar reflectivity.
The idea of lines that join points of equal value was rediscovered several times.  In 1701, Edmond Halley used such lines (isogons) on a chart of magnetic variation.  The Dutch engineer Nicholas Cruquius drew the bed of the river Merwede with lines of equal depth (isobaths) at intervals of 1 fathom in 1727, and Philippe Buache used them at 10-fathom intervals on a chart of the English Channel that was prepared in 1737 and published in 1752.  The use of such lines to describe a land surface (contour lines) was studied theoretically by Ducarla in 1771, and Charles Hutton used them when calculating the volume of a hill in 1777.  In 1791, a map of France by J. L. Dupain-Triel used contour lines at 20-metre intervals, hachures, spot-heights and a vertical section.  In 1801, the chief of the Corps of Engineers, Haxo, used contour lines at the larger scale of 1:500 on a plan of his projects for Rocca d'Aufo.R. A.

By around 1843, when the Ordnance Survey started to regularly record contour lines in Great Britain and Ireland, they were already in general use in European countries.  Isobaths were not routinely used on nautical charts until those of Russia from 1834, and those of Britain from 1838.
When maps with contour lines became common, the idea spread to other applications. Perhaps the latest to develop are air quality and noise pollution contour maps, which first appeared in the USA, in approximately 1970, largely as a result of national legislation requiring spatial delineation of these parameters. In 2007, Pictometry was the first to allow users to dynamically generate elevation contour lines to be laid over oblique images.
To maximize readability of contour maps, there are several design choices available to the map creator, principally line weight, line color, line type and method of numerical marking.
If the contour lines are not numerically labeled and adjacent lines have the same style (with the same weight, color and type), then the direction of the gradient cannot be determined from the contour lines alone.  However if the contour lines cycle through three or more styles, then the direction of the gradient can be determined from the lines.  The orientation of the numerical text labels is often used to indicate the direction of the slope.
Most commonly contour lines are drawn in plan view, or as an observer in space would view the Earth's surface: ordinary map form. However, some parameters can often be displayed in profile view showing a vertical profile of the parameter mapped. Some of the most common parameters mapped in profile are air pollutant concentrations and sound levels.  In each of those cases it may be important to analyze (air pollutant concentrations or sound levels) at varying heights so as to determine the air quality or noise health effects on people at different elevations, for example, living on different floor levels of an urban apartment.  In actuality, both plan and profile view contour maps are used in air pollution and noise pollution studies.
Labels are a critical component of elevation maps. A properly labeled contour map helps the reader to quickly interpret the shape of the terrain. If numbers are placed close to each other, it means that the terrain is steep. Labels should be placed along a slightly curved line "pointing" to the summit or nadir, from several directions if possible, making the visual identification of the summit or nadir easy.
Manual labeling of contour maps is a time-consuming process, however, there are a few software systems that can do the job automatically and in accordance with cartographic conventions, called automatic label placement.
