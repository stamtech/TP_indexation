The '''Volvo C70''' is a luxury automobile manufactured by Volvo Cars in  two generations: the first from model years 1997-2002 as coupe and from 1999-2006 as a softtop convertible.  The second generation C70 has been marketed since 2006 as a retractable hardtop convertible.
Volvo introduced the first generation C70 at the 1996 Paris Motor Show, following a European introduction as a 1997 model, and later as a 1998 model in North America &mdash; with 2.0 (sold mostly in Italy), a low-pressure turbo (2.4L) and a high-pressure turbo (2.0L and 2.3L), 5-cylinder, turbocharged petrol engines and manual and automatic transmissions.

The C70 broke Volvo's decades-long styling tradition of boxy, rectilinear designs.  According to Peter Horbury, Volvo's design chief from 1991 to 2002, with the C70, Volvo threw away the box, but "kept the toy inside!"
In a development program of 30 months and working with a Volvo 850-derived platform, Britain   s TWR (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) co-designed the car's basic design and suspension tuning with Volvo. Manufacture of the C70 was a joint venture until the two companies experienced disputes that threatened to interrupt production; TWR did not contribute to the second generation C70.
Volvo's first modern convertible, the C70 was manufactured in Uddevalla, Sweden on a separate assembly line from the 70-series sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured  an electrically-heated glass rear window, automatic (pop-up) rollover hoops, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a safety cage &mdash; a horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment.

The C70 convertible exhibited two negative traits endemic to convertibles: poor rear visibility and  pronounced ''scuttle shake'',
Early special editions featured two-tone leather interior with wood trim and a SC-901 (1998) Dolby Pro Logic I stereo with 3-disc integrated changer unit (via a cartridge) 500 watts of power and 12 high end Dynaudio speakers.
The C70 was introduced to the press in a signature color (saffron orange metallic) and for the debut marketing, the 1997 movie The Saint featured a C70 &mdash; recalling the notable connection of the Volvo P1800 and the TV series from the early 1960s, The Saint with Roger Moore as Simon Templar.
There was no 2005 model C70 in North America, the 2004 left over models were sold into 2005 there.
72,000 first generation C70s were produced in the seven years up to 2006, less than 50,000 were convertibles.
, sharing the Volvo S40 platform, designed by John Kinsey and built by Pininfarina Sverige AB, a joint venture between Pininfarina and Volvo. It went on sale in the U.S. in spring 2006.
The three-piece retractable hardtop raises or lowers in under 30 seconds and replaces both the convertible and the coupe, the latter which had been absent from Volvo's lineup since 2003.  The C70 is offered with a normally-aspirated gasoline engine with variable geometry turbocharger and common-rail direct injection.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States recently conducted its first crash tests of several convertibles and designated the C70 a "Top Safety Pick".
Safety systems include a door-mounted side impact protection inflatable which inflates upward when activated. The curtain has an extra stiff construction with double rows of slats that are slightly offset from each other. This allows them to remain upright and offer effective head protection even with the window open. The curtain also deflates slowly to provide protection should the car roll over. This is a unique solution in the automotive world.
The C70 retractable hardtop also features a roll over protection structure (ROPS) with two pyrotechnically charged roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that deploy under roll-over conditions whether the roof is retracted or not. Volvo featured this advancement in a copy of the "Volvo Saved My Life Club" brochures. There, a woman was able to walk away from an accident after she slid off an ice-covered mountain road and rolled her C70 which then slid more than  down the mountain face.
Volvo introduced an updated version of the C70, in new Flamenco Red Pearl paint, at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.  The new C70 includes a redesigned front end, new rear LED lamps, and a redesigned, wider instrument panel.  The engine and transmission remain the same as before, and the interior is largely unchanged as well. It went on sale in early 2010, as a 2011 model in North America.
