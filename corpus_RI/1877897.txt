Every year the LA Auto Show kicks off with two press days full of activity for journalists, designers and industry representatives alike.

General and gold area tickets are available to purchase for this festive event and all proceeds are donated to Homeless Healthcare Los Angeles and One Voice.
The Los Angeles Auto Show began in 1907 with ninety-nine vehicles on display at Morley   s Skating Rink.  As the auto industry grew, the auto show changed venues four times throughout the 1920s to accommodate the growing needs of vendors.  In 1926, it took place at the corner of Hill and Washington where it stayed for the next four years.  During the 1929 show, an electrical circuit in one of the airplane exhibits caught fire causing the entire show to go up in flames ending in more than $1 Million in damage.  With the help of the community, the show re-opened one day later at the Shrine Auditorium.
The show continued to prove successful throughout the 1930s, but took a down turn during the Second World War and went on hiatus from 1940 through 1951.  In 1952, the show re-opened at the Pan Pacific Auditorium with 152 vehicles on display, including those from international manufacturers.
Throughout the next 50 years, the show continued to grow becoming the success that it is today.  In the past decade, the show has changed its name from The Greater Los Angeles Auto Show to the LA Auto Show.  In 2006, the show moved its dates from early January to late November/early December, thus resulting in two shows during the year 2006, the second marking the 100 year anniversary show.
