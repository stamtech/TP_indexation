At the time of the transition, RocketMail users could either choose a Yahoo! ID, since they were not guaranteed the availability of their RocketMail ID on Yahoo!, or could use ''username'''.rm''''' as their Yahoo! ID. Thus, they were able to keep their rocketmail.com address and receive the same services as all Yahoo! users.
On 19 June 2008, Yahoo started the RocketMail brand again by allowing new users to sign up for accounts under the rocketmail.com domain, which had not been possible since its acquisition of Four11 Corporation.
