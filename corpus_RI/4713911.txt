The '''Wright Eclipse''' is a low-floor single-deck bus body built by Wright on Volvo B7 chassis. It shares its design with the Wright Solar on Scania L94 chassis.
Initially, the Eclipse was built on Volvo B7L chassis. The Volvo B7RLE was introduced in 2003 due to the unpopularity of the B7L's driveline layout with UK operators. From this time, the full name of the Wright body became '''Eclipse Metro''' for the B7L version, and '''Eclipse Urban''' for the new B7RLE version; however, all continue to be badged as Eclipse. An additional version available on the B7RLE is the Eclipse Commuter, with a higher floor throughout most of the body (though retaining a low entry), and a correspondingly higher window line.
The Eclipse and its sister design the Solar were named for a solar eclipse which was visible in the UK in 1999, the year of its introduction.
In November 2008, Wright unveiled the '''Eclipse 2''' at the Euro Bus Expo 2008, with front and rear ends facelifted to match the Wright StreetCar.
