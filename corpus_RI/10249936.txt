In 1988, original members Rick Craig and Bill Whyte left to start metal band Emerald City in Detroit. The replacements came in the form of guitarist Billy Gray and future Godsmack drummer Tommy Stewart. At that time, Halloween was in a deal with Crimson Glory management Warren Wyatt management. Halloween went around the area playing shows with Crimson Glory on their successful 1989 ''Transcendence'' tour. After a few months of that, Halloween went into the studio with producer Rob Tylak and recorded a 5 track demo entitled "Vicious Demos" which was released in 1990. Soon after, Stewart left but Gray stuck around for the ''No One Gets Out'' album.
