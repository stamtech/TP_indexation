If biologists had access to living raptors - doubtless they could do a swift genetic study and answer the question about whether dinoaurs are birds (or birds are dinosaurs or whatever) in pretty short order.  But we don't know what the answer would be because that's one experiment we can't do.   ( ) 01:26, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
In the period 1851-1855 what institutions of higher education in New York City (or close proximity) were offering degrees in engineering?  Many thanks to anyone who can assist.   ( ) 00:23, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
Let's say we have an all electric car. Could we put a small fan in the front of that car, which would turn when the wind passed it as we were driving that car. Could we then hook the fan to a small generator that could assist in the car being recharged. Thus needing to be plugged into the electrical outlet for a shorter amount of time. I'm led to believe the fan would not fully recharge the car, but why?     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 07:53, 31 March 2009 (UTC) 
You could also park it facing the wind on a windy day to let it recharge a little when you are not using it.    ( ) 13:00, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
The top of a car, the hood, and the trunk would afford at least 2 or 3 square meters of solar collector, assuming the car is not one of those wierd all solar powered cars which looks like a gust of wind would blow it off the road. It would not be optimally oriented in most cases, so it would not get the theoretical maximum solar input of about 1 kilowatt per square meter, but what is the present efficiency of solar cells in converting to electricity the possible 1 or 2 kilowatts of solar energy hitting the panels? How much kw or HP does it take for a small car to cruise at 55 miles per hour (88 km/h)? It would be less than the max output of the engine in a car such as the Prius, since the engine is sized for brisk acceleration and high speed driving. I seem to recall early hybrids from the 1970's needing only 5 HP to cruise. If so a car covered with efficient solar panels could have greatly extended range.   ( ) 15:43, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
Are there any alternatives to sleep? Things that would have the same effect as a good nights sleep but enable a person to continue on without rest?    ( ) 09:45, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
So which species would be first to bury us, say up to our necks, if allowed to breed uncontrollably, and how long would it take?   12:27, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
I have frequently observed this in real life. If you have a strong stomach, see the horrifying results of this practice at, for example, Beware, nature is cruel and vile and this picture may upset you. --  ( ) 15:54, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
President Obama is coming to London with his trusty VH-3D Sea King, the range of the Sea King is not great enough to cross the Atlantic in one push, so is it transported in a plane and flown around or does it bunny hop from ships in the Atlantic refuelling?
I'm fairly certain it would be the former, but someone recently said that it is possible for a helicopter to cross the Atlantic.     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 13:16, 31 March 2009 (UTC) 
Presidential helicopters are flown over on a cargo plane, though I am not sure if they use a C-141 or a C-5. Actually, I am not sure if the Sea King has in flight refueling capability.    ( ) 15:36, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
Seeing as how the C-141 has been retired from active service since 2004, They probably use the C-5.    ( ) 14:44, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
What can be found in the garbage and is somehow valuable? Are old electronic components valuable, if an electronic device is put apart and sold? Can old batteries be processed and re-sold? What else?--  ( ) 17:40, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
As an earlier poster wrote, the problem of separation limits the utility of much "garbage". But also transportation and marketing costs need to be considered.  A single aluminum can might be returned for 2 cents, but it you drive it to the return center using 5 cents worth of gas and use 20 minutes of time you could be working, it might not be worth it.

Is eating carnivores particularly unhealthy or dangerous? I know cultures do eat animals like dogs and cats, but I've talked to a few people who say they would never eat a carnivore because carnivore meat is dangerous/unhealthy in some way. Is this true?   ( ) 20:07, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
There's certainly a Biblical prohibition on this sort of thing. And I recall reading that only certain members of West Coast native American tribes were permitted to eat bear meat. I am guessing there must be some reason for this. And wasn't mad cow disease linked to cows eating the leftover bits from other cows?   ( ) 17:04, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

One measure could be excellence in more than one field. See Polymath. --  ( ) 09:17, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
This is actually an internal wikipedia issue but I'm a bit stuck. I need some scientific input into Samar Chatterjee, I don't understand or know the field so cannot assess the articles in terms of if the guy is notable or if it's simply an advert. Originally I thought "ah-ha! the wikiproject science people" can help - but that project seems completely dead. So I thought "ah-ha! surely the science reference desk must have some suitable boffins hanging around in their white coats. Anyone got any expertise in this area? willing to take a look? --  ( ) 23:09, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
