The '''Space Island Project''' is a project whose goal is to create a stand-alone commercial space infrastructure supporting manned business activities in Low Earth orbit (LEO) 400 to 500 miles above earth. 
The centerpiece of this project is the Space Solar Energy Initiative which will collect energy with solar panel satellites and then beam this energy to receiving towers on Earth using "very weak microwave beams." 
The Space Island Group is the organization behind this project, and plans to accomplish this through the use of technologies, vehicles and procedures developed by NASA and aerospace companies over the last 25 years.
