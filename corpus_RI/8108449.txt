Though I am in the UK this may be an international issue, but has anybody got any idea why long established companies like Norwich Union, HSA, British Steel etc feel the need to change their company name.  It must cost a fortune to do so.--  ( ) 10:41, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
Note Norwich Union has been part of Aviva since July 2002 and has been trading on the stock-markets as Aviva for a number of years too (since that date).   ( ) 13:38, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
The NGO English Nature changed its name to Natural England I think. What a waste of time, intellect, and money.   ( ) 19:07, 24 May 2009 (UTC)
How might US economic and monetary policy have to change if the population stopped growing?    14:22, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
Since the question is not about aging or slowing but an actual ''stop'' to population growth, the answer is going to be either a decline in economic growth, or a change in the make-up of that growth. Growth requires inputs, specifically labor, capital and technology. If the input of labor stops growing -- which is not the same as aging, declining labor force or anything other than stable-state labor input -- either growth will slow, or the other factors will have to increase so as to make up the difference. Immigration, for example, increases the labor component which (all else being equal) increases growth.   ( ) 10:03, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
If a manufacturer wants to incorporate a cell-phone into its products (for example, a manufacturer of hardware wants that its servers send a SMS through the cell-phone net), should it buy a normal (for the consumer market) cell-phone and attach it to the product? Or are there any providers of only a basic cell-phone at the market? A cell-phone without screen, keyboard, loudspeakers, battery.--    15:50, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
I see them once in awhile.  They have one or two rubber tubes sticking out perpendicular to traffic flow which are securely affixed to the roadway.  They stay there for a week or two then disappear.  I know they are used to monitor traffic, but what are they called?  Do they measure speed, or traffic volume, or both?  Oftentimes they are followed by a new stop sign or traffic light.

Roughly, how many humans are born per minute?  And, roughly, how many died per minute?--  ( ) 20:50, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
Do any of the sites copying Wikipedia content offer anything I can't get from Wikipedia itself (or Google cache if WP is down)? Cause it seems like they just clutter up search results for no purpose.   ( ) 21:39, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
I have been busy with coursework for the last few days and hadn't seen much of the news, then I suddenly discovered something seems to be going on. Apparently the government is about to be overthrown, noone is going to vote in the election, the queen is annoyed and the speaker of the house of commons is going to be thrown out. What is going on here?
Nothing very dramatic is happening at all. Cameron has been calling for an election for months. I think maybe the OP has been reading the paper.  ( ) 08:29, 20 May 2009 (UTC)
I know that this Saturday, May 23rd, would make the 10th anniversary of Owen Hart's death. I'm just wondering, what was the exact time of death of Owen Hart? I live in the Central Time Zone, so what was Owen Hart's time of death?     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 22:40, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
