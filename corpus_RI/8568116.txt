Earlier in 2005 Yahoo! announced the formation of the Yahoo Media Group, to be located in Santa Monica, California and to be run by  former ABC television executive Lloyd Braun. With this move Yahoo was "significantly strengthening our content pillar", according to Yahoo Chief Operating Officer at the time, Dan Rosensweig.  The formation of the Yahoo Media Group and its location at Hollywood's doorstep was considered by many to be the culmination of Yahoo's effort to become a major player in online entertainment.  Richard Bangs Adventures and Kevin Sites in the Hot Zone were widely promoted as examples of original content forthcoming from the newly formed Yahoo Media Group.
