Akismet was originally developed to integrate with a plugin for WordPress. It is now included by default in all WordPress builds since version 2.0 and activated in all WordPress.com-hosted blogs. A public Akismet API has resulted in an Automattic sponsored plugin for Movable Type, and third-party plugins for other platforms. Released under the GPL license, the Akismet plugin is free software, although the code to the Akismet system itself (and the nature of the algorithm used) has not been released.
The Akismet service is free for personal use. To use Akismet with most blogs, it is necessary to obtain a WordPress.com API key. Bloggers with a Yahoo! hosting account get a free "pro-blogger" Akismet service (which costs non-Yahoo! users $5/month) due to a deal between the two companies.
Many bloggers have complained of commenters being wrongfully flagged as spammers. Once a commenter is flagged as a spammer, it becomes difficult to participate on a WordPress blog which uses Akismet filter because comments are sent to the spam queue before approval or deletion.
There are a number of competitors to Akismet, including Mollom, Defensio, and Typepad Antispam. In addition, image or math CAPTCHA plugins are also widely used instead of Akismet.
