The organization's goal is to provide reliable electricity to health care facilities throughout The Gambia. They do so through the installation of solar panel systems and battery storage systems, providing power throughout the day.
Power Up Gambia was founded in 2006 by Kathryn Cunningham Hall, an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. While traveling to Sulayman Junkung General Hospital in The Gambia, she saw the consequences of limited electricity for Gambian patients. She founded Power Up Gambia, which installed a solar system at that hospital. Since then, the group has grown and has completed a solar panel installation at a village clinic, Somita Community Clinic. PUG is looking to expand its operations beyond the Philadelphia area as it prepares for an installation at Bansang Hospital, one of the largest in The Gambia.
