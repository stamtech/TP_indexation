A museum's collection can be used to support education in a variety of ways. For example, many museums produce teaching kits to aid school teachers in using their education resources, often in association with a school trip to the museum.
In supports of its educational activities, a museum may have an education officer, an education department (e.g., see), or even an education center, depending on its size the importance attached to its educational role.
The Smithsonian Institution in the USA provides extensive educational facilities, aimed at educators, families, and students.
A major part of museum attendance is through organised school trips to a museum where a structured visit with be used to augment and enhance the curriculum, under the direction of a school teacher, often with the help of museum staff. Typically there is some preparation for the visit beforehand and school work building on the trip afterwards.
Some schools have a special affiliation with museums, for example the New York City Museum School in the USA and The Langley Academy in the UK.
The Museum Institute for Teaching Science (MITS), based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, was founded in 1983. It provides resources to K-8 school teachers of engineering, mathematics, science, and technology. MITS initiates and sponsors innovative science teaching methods at both public and private schools in cooperation with educators at science and natural history museums.
Many larger museums provide guided tours, possibly in several languages. Audio tours are also available in many museums, using a hand-held listening device. This has been generalized to the concept of a multimedia electronic museum guide. Cell phone tours are possible if the pricing in a particular country is suitable for extensive cell phone usage.
