The '''Islamic Center of Irvine''' was founded by the local Muslim community in the city of Irvine, California on August 28, 2004. One of the largest Muslim congregations in California, an estimated 5,000 worshipers attend their weekly programs. Offering a variety of services from youth programs to senior workshops to interfaith sports activities, it is a widely respected cultural center in the Orange County. Its ideal location in the city of Irvine makes it one of the most expensive buildings in Orange County, and it is one of the most beautiful. Partnered with the Islamic Society of Orange County in nearby Garden Grove, the Orange County Islamic Foundation in Mission Viejo, and the Islamic Institute of Orange County in Anaheim, Orange County and Southern California have the most Muslims in the United States. The center has also teamed up with various churches and recently signed a friendship pact and held an event with Saddleback Church, one of the largest churches in the country.
A convicted con man, Craig Monteilh, of Tustin, CA accused the FBI of running him as a paid informant in the Center from July 2006 to October 2007, and then reneging on its deal with him. He was instructed to attend daily prayers at least three times a day and to attend the Friday Jumuah prayers. His actions made the members of the Muslim community very uncomfortable.
A restraining order was later taken out against him.
Every summer the Islamic Center of Irvine has a one month camp for kids. This is a very organized and educational camp with lots of activities and learning.
