Search Britney on Yahoo and this article will be listed number 6, number 3 on Google.  Does it matter? Well considering she's the most searched subject on Yahoo.com  it matters since I believe her article it's probably one of the most visited on the site.  It's a shame it still can't get to FA status.  It was reviewed back in May but it's hard for me to relate that information to the newer article so I'm requesting a new review.  Lots of things have been changed and added, and lots of things are going on with the subject. If anyone could please help out and give some ideas and tips on further improvement I'd greatly appreciate it since I would really like to dedicate alot of time in hopes of bringing it to FA.   00:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC) Britney is 99 years old

Uses lots of unexplained technical music industry terms
Side comment - I won't make a federal case out of it, but you shouldn't be striking my comments, just responding below. Often people write "done" or something. At least that's how it's done at  , see what it says there about "If you feel that the matter has been addressed, say so rather than striking out the reviewer's text." --    16:31, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
