Shak initially learned to play poker by logging on to Full Tilt Poker and using    play money    until she felt comfortable enough to start playing with real money.  When she started playing live, she found it to be     very different    and had to learn not to let men intimidate her.  She has said she wants to be known as a good player, not "a good player...for a woman."
She has ten tournament cashes to her name, placing her amongst the top percentile of the Women's All Time Money List. She placed 8th in the 2005 World Series of Poker Ladies' event, which was only her second live tournament. At the 2007 World Series of Poker Shak placed 2nd (out of over 800 players) in the $3K No-Limit Hold    em event.
Shak made it to the final day of Season 5 of the European Poker Tour (EPT) finishing in the top 30 out of over 500 players, according to the European Poker Tour season 5 results.
Shak is developing a clothing line which she claims the line will start with hoodies, as well as a high-end shoe line, and a line of lingerie.
As of 2009, her total live tournament winnings exceed $450,000.  Of those winnings, $363,118 have come at the WSOP.
Shak was married to fellow poker player Daniel Shak, but they are now divorced. Shak appeared on a November, 2010 episode of "reality" television program, Millionaire Matchmaker, as a "millionairess" seeking professional dating help to find a husband. 
Beth is a mother of three children.
