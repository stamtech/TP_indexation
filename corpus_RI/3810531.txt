Born Myron Mitchell on January 1, 1899, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Mitchell was nicknamed Pinky because of his father's statement, on seeing Mitchell in his crib as a baby, that "he's like a little pink rascal."
Mitchell began boxing professionally in 1917. His brother, Richie Mitchell, was also a boxer. Their two styles were quite different, however. Richie was known for all-action bouts while Pinky, according to a later historian, "became a pariah in Milwaukee rings" due to his "lethargic performances" in boxing matches.
In 1922 Mike Collins, the publisher of a Minneapolis weekly newspaper, the ''Boxing Blade'', created the light welterweight category and asked his readers to vote for the man they felt was the best fighter at 140 pounds. Mitchell won the balloting and was recognized on November 15, 1922, as the first light welterweight champion. The National Boxing Association (NBA) followed suit and recognized Mitchell as champion.
Mitchell defended his title at least six times.
His defense against Mushy Callahan saw Mitchell lose his title in September 1926. After losing to Callahan, Mitchell never won another fight and retired in 1928.
After he retired, Mitchell twice ran for sheriff of Milwaukee County, losing both times.
He died on March 11, 1976.
