The result was '''keep'''.   ( ) 11:55, 19 January 2008 (UTC) 
Non notable cellular phone. This article has been tagged for references for more than six months, but hasn't yet been improved. Too few substantial and reliable references exist to establish notability for this phone. Wikipedia is not a cell phone guide. Wikipedia is not a Nokia catalog.   ( ) 20:03, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
Now, for the first bolded part, I can see not breaking this out--Nokia's article is likely too big for this.  The second, the entire paragraph, demonstrates that notability MUST be established by the subject in order to have it's own article (debatable that this has been done with current refs, and I can't find any others), if not, what is there should be moved to a broader article, the example given was all products/services, but with something like this, families of phones would likely be sufficient.  
I'm not going to provide a distinct Keep/Delete opinion, as it really is not clear in my opinion whether notability has been established, and the open discussion in the   is covering that matter; however, I will put what I would reference out there in hope that it can help with a decision here.
