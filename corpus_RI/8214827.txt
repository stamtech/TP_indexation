Prior to 1979, the only high dollar tournament a person could enter was the WSOP.  1972 WSOP Main Event Champion and outspoken ambassador for poker, Amarillo Slim saw this as an opportunity.  "The World Series of Poker was so successful that everybody wanted more than one tournament," he said.  Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979.  Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event. 
One of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure.  The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool.  The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure.  In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third. This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.
In 1983, X Poker Hall of Famers made it to the cash in various tournaments at the SBOP.  Jack Strauss lost to two time World Series of Poker bracelet winner Hans Lund in the SBOP Main Event.  Berry Johnston would finish third in one event while Bobby Baldwin would make it to two cashes.  Billy Baxter, who would later gain fame for suing the IRS in Baxter v United States, also made it to the cash in one event.  Sarge Ferris, an almost forgotten member of the Poker Hall of Fame, won the No Limit 2-7 Lowball.
The 1983, tournament also witnessed Gabe Kaplan from Welcome Back, Kotter win another SBOP tournament.  When ''Welcome Back, Kotter'' went off the air in 1979, its lead character started a career in poker.  During the early 1980s, Kaplan's success, particularly at the SBOP, led him to be considered among poker's elite.  Kaplan made money in two events and won one.
