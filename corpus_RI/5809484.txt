Currently the '''340 & 341''' follow the same route from Walsall through Reedswood, Bentley and Lodge Farm up until Lane Head Bridge, Short Heath.
Here the 340 cuts through Straight Road to join Coppice Lane, which indirectly leads a straight road into Willenhall. 
The 341 meanwhile travels along Bloxwich Road North and Pooles Lane to join the Lichfield Road. Once on this road the 341 deviates off to serve the New Invention estate. 
The 341 then comes back out of New Invention, travels back along the Lichfield Road to New Invention The Square, before going back on itself to join the Cannock Road which leads onto Coppice Lane and the straight road into Willenhall.
The start of the 342 route is completely different. Firstly buses leave Walsall via Reedswood but then travel through the Beechdale estate. They then travel through Leamore until they join Pooles Lane. Here the 342 travels up to New Invention and follows the same route as the 341 up until Coppice Lane. Quite bizarrely the route turns off along Straight Road as if a 340 heading back to Walsall, but at Lane Head Bridge travels along High Road before cutting through Short Heath and coming out a little bit further up Coppice Lane. From here it follows the same route as the 340 and 341 up until very near Willenhall where it travels around the edge of the town and serves the front end, rather than the back. This could be due to the isolation of the 340/1 terminus at night time.
Currently routes 340 and 341 are interlinked so once at Willenhall, buses switch services so that the bus which has just arrived as the 340 will depart as a 341 and vice versa for services arriving as 341's. During the evening peak to improve reliability, buses now have 20-minutes between departures, and so also change routes in Walsall.
Despite buses leaving Walsall at a combined fifteen minute frequency, a 340 leaves Willenhall two minutes before a 341, giving a 28 minute wait for the next bus.
The 341 was operated by National Express West Midlands for at least 23 years using the same type of bus, the MCW Metrobus and did so up until 28 November 2009, when the last ever MCW Metrobus to run from Walsall operated the final 341E of the day to New Invention. However from June 2009, one Volvo B10L low floor single deck was allocated to the routes each day. This then went on to operate an evening duty on the 366 and 394 services (to Sutton Coldfield and Brownhills respectively). From early November 2009, when six of the remaining twelve MCW Metrobuses were withdrawn, the allocation was mostly Volvo B10Ls of both Alexander Ultra and Wright Liberator bodywork, with Volvo B6LEs and Volvo B7RLEs also making regular appearances. MCW Metrobuses did make regular appearances of the route for the rest of the month until their withdrawal on 28 November, leaving the route being operated by only low floor single decks.
From December, the most common vehicle used on the routes is the Volvo B6LE, which also began regularly operating the once B10L working. Despite this, officially the official allocation is Dennis Trident 2s, however, these only appear on the routes on Saturdays. From May 2010 following the North Walsall Network Review, Walsall Garage was finally able to make the services mostly double deck operated again.
It is also worth noting, that despite only 6 buses needed to operate the 340/1, 7 individual buses run along the route on weekdays, with the 341E working at 0850 from New Invention to Walsall normally being operated by a random Volvo B6LE.
No known changes are due.
