I don't like licenses so i had to choose one below, I believe anything that is on the internet or anything made, etc.. is free to copy and distribute  and or change and the only thing that would make it wrong would be that they say that they created the original program, artwork, product, etc.. but they may say that they changed the artwork to fit them or did some work on it, etc... again as long as either the person says either: A) they didn't create the original and what they have done and B) on the distributing thing, they only say option A) -  or The keep quiet about who originally made the artwork and neither do they say that they created it. -- I guess you could call if you want the statement above my license... :) so yes you may distribute it freely by any means.
