He signed his first record deal with Heavenly Records at the height of Britpop in 1996, as one third of The Hybirds.*
In 1999 when the band split, he branched out on his own and away from guitar-led pop, signing to Mute Records as Echoboy   after Daniel Miller heard his self-released 12 " ''Flashlegs (Suite)''.
He went on to release several self-produced solo albums on Mute as well as Giraffe, which was produced by Flood, and having put together a band he toured extensively with, amongst others, Elastica, Add N to (X) and Broadcast .
He was famously asked by Noel Gallagher to join Oasis, which led ''The Sun'' to claim "He's not mad for it&nbsp;    he's just mad".
Both Echoboy and The Hybirds performed several sessions for John Peel's radio show. *
He is also known for producing and remixing other artists (including Tenebrous Liar, Doves, Electrelane and Starsailor). 
In 2003 he was asked by Jason Pierce to play bass guitar in Spiritualized, with whom he toured throughout 2003-05. He also played bass on and co-engineered the band's 2008 album ''Songs in A&E''.
In 2005/06 he released a set of five limited edition 7" singles under the pseudonym Modlang.
During 2005-09 he played guitar with both Starsailor and Soulsavers with Mark Lanegan, playing guitar on the 2009 Starsailor album ''All the Plans'' and on the Soulsavers albums ''It's Not How Far You Fall, It's the Way You Land'' and ''Broken''. He also co-wrote two of the songs on ''Broken''.
In 2008 he formed The Cold Light of Day, releasing the limited edition EP ''Flesh and Blood'' in April 2009.
In October 2009 he left The Cold Light of Day to pursue other projects and released a solo album ''Laments'' in July 2010, which made it into the NME's '50 best albums of the year so far' list. 
He is currently working on his next album, which will be released later in 2011.
