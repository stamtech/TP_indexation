In June 2005, the acquisition of PSEG by Exelon, a Chicago and Philadelphia based utility conglomerate, was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; however, the deal was never consummated and eventually dissolved after it became clear that it would not win state regulatory approval.
In 2009, PSEG announced plans to install solar panels on 200,000 utility poles in its service area in a project costing $773 million, the largest such project in the world. The Solar 4 All project intends to increase the capacity for renewable energy in New Jersey and is expected to be completed in 2013. In addition, PSEG is building four solar farms in Edison, Hamilton, Linden, and Trenton.
PSEG currently serves nearly three quarters of New Jersey's population in a service area consisting of a  diagonal corridor across the state from Bergen to Gloucester Counties. PSE&G is the largest provider of gas and electric service, servicing 1.7 million gas customers and 2.1 million electric customers in more than 300 urban, suburban and rural communities, including New Jersey 's six largest cities.
In 2001, PSEG received The Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards in Coastal and Ocean Resource Management in the category of Excellence in Business Leadership for its Estuary Enhancement Program.
