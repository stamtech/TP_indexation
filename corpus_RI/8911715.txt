I had a cell-phone contract and after I had canceled it, I could still use the SIM card (for emergencies only). For that purpose, a cell-phone with an expired card can still connect to any tower, but does this generate costs for the cell-phone company? --    12:51, 18 November 2009 (UTC)

How you tag a account as a legitimate alternate account?     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 17:10, 18 November 2009 (UTC) 
Another good thing to do is to be logged in to your main account when you visit   to create the alt account, as I did when I created  . That way everyone can see in the log who created the account ().
