The college was formed in 2005-2006 when the three public schools in Wodonga; Wodonga High School, Wodonga West Secondary College, and Mitchell Secondary College merged together and pooled resources, as part of a plan to address long-term population growth in Wodonga.
Wodonga Middle Years College has two main programs that cater for students in years 7, 8 and 9.
All students in year 7 take part in the Authentic Learning program, designed to ease the transition from primary to high school. Students in years 8 and 9 undertake the Individual Learning Programs, where they choose their own subjects within certain guidelines.
