The '''Volvo VCC''' is a large concept MPV luxury estate to rival that of the Mercedes Benz R Class and BMW V series. The Volvo VCC estate is supposed to be ready as a production model by 2010, or 2011. This estate will share many of its parts and components with current Volvo models like the S80, V70, and XC70 vehicles to cut down on production costs. The VCC production model will supposedly be called the V90 estate as hinted by Volvo executives. The estate will carry over all of Volvo's traditional safety, quality, and environmental values.
This estate is a completely new design for the Volvo Car Corp. The concept vehicle shows a triple stacked parallel head lights that bend around corners as in active bi-xenon headlights using static energy. The interior displays some of the most highest quality in refined luxury. The car shows off a first of having leather carpeting on the rugs of the estate. The production model is expected to carry over three rows of seating also. The production model will not use suicide doors as seen in the concept car for safety reasons. Volvo has confirmed that the production model will use much of the concept front and rear ends. The car is believed to be built on the Ford EUCD platform or Ford D3 platform platform at its Torslanda Plant in Gothenburg, Sweden.
A larger sedan variant is expected to be spun off this estate as with all Volvo sedan estate combinations. If so, this new full size luxury sedan will be Volvo's first real attempt at the Audi A8 and BMW 7-Series market.
Its main competitors will include the Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz E Class, BMW 7-Series and the Volkswagen Phaeton.
