On December 8, 2010, IKAROS passed by Venus at about 80,800&nbsp;km distance, completing the planned mission successfully, and entered extended operation phase.
The IKAROS probe is the world's first spacecraft to use solar sailing as the main propulsion. It plans to demonstrate four key technologies (comments in parentheses refer to figure):
The mission also  includes investigations of aspects of interplanetary space, such as the gamma-ray burst, solar wind and cosmic dust.
The probe's ALADDIN instrument (ALDN-S and ALDN-E) measured the variation in dust density while its Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) measured the polarization of gamma-ray bursts during its six month cruise.
If successful, IKAROS is to be followed by a  sail, intended to journey to Jupiter and the Trojan asteroids, later in the decade.
The square sail, deployed via a spinning motion using 0.5&nbsp;kg tip masses (1 in key at right), is  on the diagonal and is made of a  thick sheet of polyimide (3 in key at right). A thin-film solar array is embedded in the sail (4 in key at right). PowerFilm, Inc. provided the thin-film solar array. Eighty blocks of LCD panels are embedded in the sail, whose reflectance can be adjusted for attitude control (2 in key at right). The sail also contains eight dust counters on the opposite face as part of the science payload.
IKAROS was successfully launched together with ''Akatsuki'' (the Venus Climate Orbiter) aboard an H-IIA rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center on 21 May 2010.  
IKAROS spun at 20   25&nbsp;revolutions per minute and finished unfurling its sail on 11 June 2010. The craft contains two tiny ejectable cameras, DCAM1 and DCAM2. DCAM2 was used to visualise the sail after deployment on 14 July 2010.
The sail finished deploying on 10 June 2010.
 and on 23 July announced successful attitude control.
IKAROS continues to spin at approximately 2 rpm, requiring the LCD panels to be cycled at that rate for attitude control.
