CR&nbsp;72 is one of two county routes that are shared by Rockland and Orange County. The other is County Route&nbsp;106. The total length combined for Orange CR&nbsp;72 and Rockland CR is 3.4 miles (1.8 in Orange and 1.6 in Rockland).
Rockland County Route&nbsp;72 begins at the Orange county line in Eagle Valley.  The road, now known as '''Sterling Mine Road''', enters Rockland briefly before turning back into Orange County for a short distance. It returns to Rockland County and intersects with CR&nbsp;68 at . CR&nbsp;86 now parallels Route&nbsp;72 as it heads into Sloatsburg. The main highway heads to north for a short distance before turning to the south. Route&nbsp;72 enters the community of Sterlington and terminates at an interchange with NY&nbsp;17 just south of downtown Sloatsburg.
County Route&nbsp;72 mainly resides in Sloatsburg, New York. Sloatsburg dates back to the Indian name of Pothat, being renamed after the Sloat family, who had come to the country in 1639 from Denmark. The Sloat family eventually settled in America in 1754. Along nearby NY&nbsp;17, the Sloat family's house still stands.  
Around 1982, the Rockland County Highway Department had a different system of highways around the county. The most southern north&ndash;south highways in Rockland County were designated with low numbers, such as 1, 2, 3 or 4. County Route&nbsp;72, being the westernmost county-maintained highway, was designated as '''County Route&nbsp;1'''. When Rockland County renumbered their highway system, County Route&nbsp;1, was renumbered to match up with Orange County Route&nbsp;72 at the Orange/Rockland County border.
