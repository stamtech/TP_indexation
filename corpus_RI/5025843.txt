Central Connect have branded Dennis Darts in a dedicated livery for Shuttle services for the NEC in Birmingham.
On 7 June 2010, Central Connect launched the Signature brand with two Solihull routes that were taken over from National Express West Midlands, the S2 (S2/S2A/S2C) and S3 are operated with Optare Solo SR veichles with leather seating and on-board WIFI.
On 26 July 2010, The signature service expanded to the new route 82 (replaced 19W/19X Coventry services) using a Mercedes-Benz Citaro and route S4 (taken over from Grosenvor) using MCV Evolution buses again both route feature leather seating and free on-board WIFI. However on weekdays a MCV Evolution is used on the S2/S2A/S2C and a Optare Solo SRis put on the S4. However from January 12, 3 or 4 Mercedes citaros shall be used on the S2 and S3 and they are the same as the two used on the 82.
From 27 March 2011, the Signature brand expands again with the addition of the 30 service (Solihull-Acocks Green) which is being withdrawn by National Express West Midlands. The current route and timetable will remain unchanged.
School services are '''NOT''' included.
In a deal which was finalised in March 2007, Wessex Connect took over two of the city's park and ride schemes. The Long Ashton operation was won from Bristol City Council, while car park firm NCP gave Wessex Connect the contract for the Avonmouth scheme.
Approximately 68 buses run by South Gloucestershire Bus and Coach Company were taken over in late 2007 and most will be replaced by newer environmentally-friendly easy-access vehicles. Routes which are currently contracted from Bristol City Council and South Gloucestershire Council to South Gloucestershire Bus and Coach Company will transfer to Wessex Connect. The change of ownership will take place gradually as each contract is due to be renewed with the relevant local council.
A third series of services, ''Ulink'', was developed in collaboration with the University of the West of England to provide a new high-quality low-cost bus service for students and staff.
From 11 May 2009, Wessex Connect started operating a new branded Uni-Connect U18 service between Bath University and Lower Oldfield Park via Bath City Centre. The fleet of U18 buses are painted in a dark blue colour scheme. Due to the success of this route Wessex Connect started to operate more routes within Bath.
On 27 September 2010, Wessex Connect introduced services on two more routes in Bath, this time under the 'Royal Bath' brand name. The 5 and 10 services, running to Twerton and Southdown respectively, are in addition to frequent services on both of those routes run by their main competitor in Bath, First.

On 3 March 2008, Central Connect purchased the Go West Midlands operations from Go-Ahead. This has increased the buses owned by Central Connect by over 140, meaning that Central Connect now operates over 300 vehicles and has become the second biggest operator in the West Midlands area after National Express West Midlands.
On the 21 July 2008 a partnership was forged between Diamond, Centro and Sandwell MBC to improve 5 key bus routes in the Black Country (most of which have now been withdrawn/reduced) - the services having new buses branded Black Diamond. These were originally intended for the 401, 402, 404B, 404E and 404H  These buses operating on the 9/404E are mainly Plaxton Centro/Volvo B7RLE as well as Plaxton Centro/MAN 12.240's and 14.220's but there have been several re-painted Dennis Darts/Wright DAFs in operation. On weekends operate on the 16 and other routes.
In 2009, Diamond purchased 7 "Royal" Black Diamond. These are classed as royal as they contain Leather seating and wood effect flooring. 2 of these buses are used for route 202/204 Halesowen - Bromsgrove and occasionally used on the 002, 255, 256, 257 and 404E.
In 2009, Rotala transferred, fuelling much controversy among staff and passengers, 7 of the Plaxton Centro buses from Diamond to Wessex Connect, this being due to a contract with the University of the West of England to provide services.
Prior to the ultimate transfer, sister company Central Connect loaned some of the buses for some of their routes. These turned up on several routes including Route 192 Birmingham - Kidderminster and 904 Birmingham - Sutton Coldfield
In a working partnership with Worcestershire County Council, a new fleet of Red Diamond bus services are beginning to operate in Redditch, Worcestershire. These buses are mainly Diamond owned Wright Eclipse/Volvo B7RLE but there have been several re-painted Dennis Darts/Wright DAFs in operation.
