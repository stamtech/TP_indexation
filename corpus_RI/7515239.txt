  It is held annually in Las Vegas.  The first WSOP occurred in 1970, and was an invitational wherein Benny Binion invited six of the most best known poker players to The Horseshoe Casino.  At first, the WSOP grew slowly.  It took 11&nbsp;years before the event drew as many as 100&nbsp;participants, with 104&nbsp;entries in 1982.  In the early 1980s, the introduction of satellites allowed people to win the entry fee to the tournament for less than the $10,000 buy-in.  By 2002, there were over 2,100&nbsp;entrants into the tournament.  Participation peaked in 2006 with 8,773&nbsp;participants. The WSOP allows anybody, whether seasoned veteran or rank amateur, to compete for the World Championship if they can afford the $10,000 buy in.  In 2005, Harrah's Entertainment purchased the rights to the WSOP.  Since acquiring the WSOP, Harrah's moved the event from the Horseshoe and is now played at Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.
The first WSOP was not a freeze out tournament, but rather an event with a set start and stop time with the winner determined by secret ballot.  In 1973, a second event, five-card stud, was added.  Over the years, most of the major poker variants have been played at least once.  Since 2007, the WSOP has consisted of 55 events, of which all but the "Main Event" have been finished in about a month.  In 2008, to increase marketing opportunities,  the Main Event final table was delayed until November.  The winner of each event wins a WSOP bracelet and a monetary prize based on the number of entrants. The WSOP bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Victories in the WSOP prior to 1976 are also known as "bracelets".   The series culminates with the $10,000&nbsp;no-limit hold'em "Main Event", which has attracted thousands of entrants since 2004. The victor receives a multi-million dollar prize.  The winner of the WSOP Main Event is considered to be the World Champion of Poker.
Johnny Moss was the first person to win the WSOP.  Since then only Moss and Stu Ungar have won the Main Event three times; Ungar is the only one to have won three times in the freeze-out format. Moss, Ungar, Doyle Brunson and Johnny Chan are the only people who have won the Main Event two years in a row.  Johnny Chan's second victory in 1988 was featured on the 1998 film ''Rounders''. Peter Eastgate was the youngest person to win the Main Event when he won it in 2008, at 22 years of age.  He held that record for one year, when 21 year old Joe Cada became the youngest Main Event champion.
The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, the bracelet events have occurred every year in Las Vegas.  The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas.  The 2007 Main Event, a GBP 10,000 buy-in no-limit hold 'em tournament, was won by Norwegian online prodigy Annette Obrestad on the day before her 19th birthday. This made her the youngest person to win a WSOP bracelet, a record that cannot be broken in the Las Vegas WSOP under current laws because the minimum legal age for casino gaming in Nevada is 21. Obrestad could play in the WSOPE because the minimum age for casino gaming in the United Kingdom is 18.  The World Series of Poker Europe has a unique identity from the Las Vegas WSOP, but according to Harrah's will remain true to the traditions and heritage.
