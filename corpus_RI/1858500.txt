Witteles entered his first tournament at the 2005 World Series of Poker, where he played the $1500 Limit Texas hold 'em event.  He finished in third place out of a field of 1,049 entrants. He took home nearly $116,000 after getting knocked out of the tournament by 21-year-old Eric Froehlich.  As a gimmick, Witteles used a small Head & Shoulders bottle to protect his cards while playing, in reference to his online moniker "Dan Druff."
During the same World Series of Poker, Witteles played the $3,000 Limit Hold 'em event finishing first, earning a World Series of Poker gold bracelet and $347,385.  Witteles set a World Series of Poker record, as no other player in history has finished better in their first two events.  He was also named CardPlayer Magazine's 2005 World Series of Poker Player of the Year.
Witteles was a victim of the Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet "Superuser" cheating scandal.  He and several other online players took part in uncovering and proving the cheating.  This attracted enough media attention to where it became the subject of a story on the TV news program "60 Minutes", where Witteles was featured.  The episode aired on November 30, 2008.  Witteles appeared on the front page of The Washington Post about the same matter.   On December 16, 2009, he appeared on CNBC to discuss the cheating.  In the CNBC special, Witteles claimed that legalization and regulation of online poker was necessary in order to prevent future cheating scandals.
In March 2008, Witteles was selected among eight other top online poker players to participate in ESPN's "Online Poker Think Tank."
Witteles is a former part-owner of the neverwinpoker.com poker forum, where he regularly participated and hosted two internet radio programs. In November 2009, Witteles left neverwinpoker along with site founder Bryan Micon. The two started a new site called donkdown.com, taking the previous site's message board and radio show along with them. 
As of 2011, his total live tournament winnings exceed $800,000. His 12 cashes at the WSOP account for $654,553 of those winnings. 
Witteles has a son, Benjamin, born in October 2010. During his radio show, he identified the child's mother as a college friend that he reunited with on Facebook, after being out of contact for 16 years. They plan to marry in 2011.
