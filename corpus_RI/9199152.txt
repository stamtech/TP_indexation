Hi. I noticed  . We are desperately needing good svg blank maps of the states of India (with the districts lightly outlined) for use in pushpin in infoboxes. Basically I'm looking for a full set of maps of each of the Indian states in the style of  . Like your Assam map but blank. Amazingly nobody has created blank svgs for India yet and we've had to put up with the horrible colored maps for ages. Could the graphics lab please create some good quality blank svgs and list the coordinates like on the Pakistan image page to make it possible to use for pin maps? Thanks.        19:59, 8 December 2009 (UTC)
The map you give as an example comes from a range of maps showing countries and larger regions, including continents; for those, a position with respect to the world makes sense. For Quebec, currently all maps show the region in relation to Canada. An orthographic projection can of course be made, but I just want to make sure beforehand that this is not requested for secessionist purposes. By the way, you might also consider asking at  .

This article could be improved considerably with a map.  is going to be the best source for topography and the names of things.  gives a good overview. Walking tracks should be included - you can't drive most places there.   ( ) 04:35, 13 December 2009 (UTC)

Is something wrong with the older locator maps, such as this one:
Of course, the old map is not an SVG, but locating is just a dot placed over any map - whether it is SVG or JPG doesn't really matter, does it?   ( ) 15:42, 17 December 2009 (UTC)
Remove them and put in new text. It's Times New Roman, all-caps, bold italic. You can leave the original text in while you put in new text to get an idea of the 'right' size. (But of course, any size goes, as long as it's readable yet subtle.)   ( ) 09:08, 26 November 2009 (UTC)
I just uploaded a new version.  I not only fixed the big blue text block, I also enlarged the Legend, inserted a new locator map of Venezuela, set the ocean color to the English Wikipedia standard, changed the dashed border to a line, and enlarged the names of the islands.  I also pulled the title of the map and the little teeney coordinate numbers ''inside'' the map, where they belong.  All of these edits, in my opinion at least, make the map a bit easier to read and understand.  Hope you like them.    ( ) 15:01, 30 January 2010 (UTC)
I notice the existing maps don't match their description either since they don't include the unincorporated communities.  I'll see what I can do.   ( ) 15:29, 27 January 2010 (UTC) Based on the county map it looks like there ought to be a Glendale, KS as well.   ( ) 16:55, 27 January 2010 (UTC)
I have started working on this, but it may take a while...  --19:53, 4 February 2010 (UTC)     Preceding   comment added by   (       )  
Took 6 hours to make! Was this how you intended it to be? --    22:50, 11 February 2010 (UTC)
