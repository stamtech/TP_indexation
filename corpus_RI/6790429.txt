I tried disabling and re-enabling the Java Active-X control in the browser, but it didn't help. I am wondering if it is because I'm using a 64-bit Vista (although Java doesn't work both in my 32-bit and 64-bit IE's); but it was working before - I just bought this laptop a few weeks ago, and it had everything preinstalled on it. That's where I got the 1.6.0.02 version from, it was among the driver installation files, but it didn't help either. I wasn't able to find any solutions online as well. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance! '''&nbsp;  &nbsp;''' 00:36, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I checked Image stabilization, but didn't find an answer, so maybe y'all have an idea.
Is there a way to take an older, somewhat shaky, video file and run it through some software (free would be nice) that will reduce the shakiness?  Thanks.    ( ) 03:49, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
Thank you Mboverload.  I checked the presentation, and that's exactly the type of thing I would like to do.  Of course, since that's professional software, I'm too cheap to buy it.  So if there's a consumer or free program that will do the same thing, I'd be interested.  Thanks for your detective work.   ( ) 15:43, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I have a server at my house that I keep my web site on.  Yesterday my default page was modified and I have no idea how.  The new version of the page simply read "core-project" - No formatting, page title, nothing - just that text.  So far it does not look like any changes to other files were made.
I had been on the server yesterday, but I don't think I was at the time stamp of the file change.  Even if I was, I did not: download anything, edit the web site, run any new software, do anything unusual, I did not even check mail.  I did go on the web but I don't think I went to any page I was not familiar with (Netflix, Amazon, maybe the IMDB).  Now maybe I did go somewhere else, but I'm 99% sure it wasn't at the time of the change.
Afterwords I did do a Windows update and 2 upgrades were installed: KB890830 and KB951748.  Those patches did not look like the fix to my problem to me.  My anti-virus software was up to date and I did a scan with no problems found.
I can put the page back like it was, but I am very concerned as to how and why this happened.  I wouldn't think it would be a virus - wouldn't it do more than modify the 1 page and in a silly way?
Does anyone have any ideas about this?
What would make a page say just "core-project" (no quotes)?
Thanks--  ( ) 06:57, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
Thanks so far.  I didn't even think about the logs.  I just assumed that if it was hacking, logs wouldn't show it.  Also, I do not have FTP running - but I better double check that.  The only thing I see suspicious in the log is this activity.

What are the extra sub directories like "_vti_cnf" and "_vti_pvt"?  I assumed FrontPage made those.  Maybe I am wrong about that? I do not have a "_vti_bin" directory on my web site.
I'm going to see what I can find based on this info but I wanted to get this out to you ASAP.
Thanks again.
I'm trying to download files that require me logged in, and so I need to cookie in order to download it in an external programme. I have done some packet captures and the cookies are missing from the HTTP headers in DTA when it's running natively in Linux, whereas the same configuration in wine works flawlessly. Is this a bug in Firefox or is there some hidden setting that I do not know of? --   |   |   08:30, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I'm a LaTeX noob and I spent the last couple of days learning how to convert my MS Word document into LaTeX. Tables excluded, it was fairly easy, however the bibliography is still missing. What's the better approach to produce the list of sources? Right now, I have about 30 sources cited, but the document will grow until about 100, perhaps. Can you help me? Thanks in advance for your replies.   ( ) 10:17, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
Before I create the stub, (or someone else beats me to it), I would like to ask your advice - Is an article "beagle board" worthy of an article or not?  ( ) 14:25, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I will be acquiring a laptop and setting it up with Linux (probably Kubuntu) in the near future. I have a Nokia 3220 and will be buying a Bluetooth USB device to transfer data between the phone and laptop. Can I use the phone as a modem? If so, will the use of Bluetooth create security issues?    15:16, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
On Wikipedia it appears as a "W" on google it appears as a "G". What is it called and is there html to personalize the one on your website? --  ( ) 16:27, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I am looking to buy an MP3 player for my mom to listen to audiobooks, and I am looking for some hints. It needs to have a simple interface and doesn't need much 'fancy' functionality (she's not the technophile I am :) ), and needs to be able to resume long mp3 files at the moment they were stopped. Bookmarking would also be helpful. Does anyone have any suggestions for what model / ranges I should be looking at, or what other criteria I should consider? Thanks muchly in advance! &mdash;    16:51, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
Hi. Let's say I create a Yahoo email accoount and a Gmail email account. I insert each other email address to forward every email received to the other account. That is, an email received to the Gmail account will forward it to the Yahoo account and vice versa. If now I use one of them and send an email to the other one, will it loop forever? Will there ever a time when the email storage reach full capacity if it loops forever? Now, maybe they've set a limit to the number of emails you can receive per day, which will stop the infinite loop. If I start sending a 10MB mail (the maximum allowed I think) every day, will the storage of my Gmail or Ymail ever get full? This article says that Yahoo! Mail offers unlimited email storage capacity. Is that really true? What if I keep uploading/sending emails to that Yahoo! Mail account every day. Will it never get full? Thanks for your answers.

I understand (I think) fourier transform - but can't see how bit-reversed addressing could be useful here.
What exactly does 'bit reversed' mean in this context? What sort of FFT would use this?  ( ) 18:55, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I read somewhere (I don't remember where) that it's possible to connect "directly" to the internet (without going through an ISP) but that the equipment needed to do so is expensive. Still, I'm curious about how this would be done, so...how would that be done?   ( ) 20:39, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I think the simple answer is that '''The Internet is not a series of tubes.''' There's no water main to connect to. --   03:06, 6 August 2008 (UTC)
I have just moved from a WinMe computer, where I used StarOffice5.2, to an XP computer that has Microsoft Word installed. Is there any converter that could convert my hundreds of letters from StarOffice format to something readable by Word please?   ( ) 21:11, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
Sorry I should have been clearer - I have hundreds of letters to convert, I am looking for somthing that can convert them in a batch rather than repeatedly loading and saving then in OpenOffice etc, which would take days. Even something that could just crudely convert them to .txt files by stripping out non-text characters would be better than nothing. Thanks.   ( ) 11:47, 6 August 2008 (UTC)
I have just moved to an XP computer after previously using a WinMe one, and I hate the needless complexity and pointlessness of having to use accounts for different users and statuses on the computer, which just gets in the way. Is there any way of using an XP computer without any accounts please? Thanks.   ( ) 21:20, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
