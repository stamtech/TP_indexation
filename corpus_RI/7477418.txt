Because of its role as a provider of citizen journalism, The UpTake is a not-for-profit organization. As such, many of its journalists have to rely on technology, such as cell phone cameras, technically outclassed by professional equipment. This financial disadvantage has spurred The UpTake to develop innovative methods of low-cost information gathering and reporting, such as live broadcasting from cell phone camera feeds.
The UpTake is presently led by board chair Chris Dykstra, executive producer Michael McIntee, and executive director Jason Barnett. Its staff includes many "everyday people" working as citizen journalists, and the "Contact Us" page on TheUpTake.org encourages anyone interested in working with The UpTake to contact McIntee or Barnett.

On January 5, 2009, when the final batch of absentee ballots in the recount were opened, checked, sorted, and counted, The UpTake broadcast the entire process live via streaming video on TheUpTake.org. Its initial count for DFL candidate Al Franken's lead after the absentee ballots were sorted aloud was 223; the number appeared on breaking reports on other websites, including FiveThirtyEight.com, until an election official announced that Franken's unofficial lead was actually 225.
The Center for Public Integrity listed The UpTake as one of its "Top Ten Websites from 2008". In a tongue-in-cheek reference to an infamous ballot challenge by Republican candidate Norm Coleman's campaign, the list identified The UpTake as:
On January 18, 2011, The UpTake announced it had become the first online-only news organization to get a seat in the Minnesota Capitol press room.
