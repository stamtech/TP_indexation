In March 2010, he finished second in GUKPT London for   84,700 before finally capturing his first UK title in the Luton leg of August of the same year. Channing's victory for   64,050 elevated him into the top 3 of the all-time GUKPT ranking list.

Channing's best effort at a bracelet came in 2010 when he finished second in the   5,000 No Limit Hold'em Shootout for $273,153.
