The album features a mix of musical styles and was described as exemplifying the 'nu-psychedelia' musical genre by British music magazine the ''NME''. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that his lyrics are upbeat and disposable. Critical reception was generally positive with the record appearing in the "Best album of 1999" lists issued by several magazines. The band were disappointed with the relative lack of success of the album's singles and went on "pop strike" as a result, issuing the 'lo-fi', all-Welsh language ''Mwng'' as the follow-up to ''Guerrilla'' in May 2000.
The Super Furry Animals had originally intended to work on the album with Gorwel Owen, who co-produced 1996's ''Fuzzy Logic'' and 1997's ''Radiator'' with the band. According to Rhys, however, Owen felt "burned out" after producing other bands solidly for a year and a half and asked the group to wait until he had chance to rest. The Super Furry Animals were so keen to record that they decided to produce the album themselves. ''Guerrilla'' was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire during the middle of 1998. Although Rhys has stated that the group met Gabriel several times during recording, and that they thought he was "a good old guy", Real World was chosen because it was near to the band's homes in Wales rather than because of its association with the former Genesis frontman. Sessions were "much less volatile than usual" according to Rhys, as the five members of the band felt they had to reach consensus over everything because they were producing the record themselves   while recording their previous albums the band would often fall out and shout at each other safe in the knowledge that Owen would act as a mediator and take the final decisions. Bassist Guto Pryce has stated that the band also felt happier during recording sessions for ''Guerrilla'' because they had their pets with them at Real World, and were able to relax and enjoy the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the British summer.
During recording, the band used a sampler for the first time and hired many different musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing "the music to dictate itself". The song "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. "Some Things Come From Nothing" came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was "written and recorded simultaneously" by the group. "The Sound of Life Today" is a 22 second sample of "Some Things Come From Nothing" played backwards. According to Rhys the band gave the track a "really pompous title" so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a "collection of noises". "Do or Die", "Fire in My Heart" and "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" were written by Rhys while "The Door to This House Remains Open" developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for "Northern Lites" was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments "lying around" Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.
Around 25 tracks were recorded for ''Guerrilla'', with all members of the band agreeing to trim this number down for the final track listing of the record in order to make a 45-minute long album which was immediate. The group chose the 'up' songs, the "digital songs with more of a constant rhythm", that they had recorded and left off the 'down' tracks to create a positive "brash and light-weight" record   a "disposable pop album that's too good to throw away". According to Bunford, some of the more guitar-orientated songs the group recorded were included on initial track listings and were only left off the record at the last minute in favour of more electronic sounding tracks. Rhys has said that the decision to include "The Teacher" on the album was a decisive moment, as the track is "the most stupid thing on the record"   if a more downbeat song, such as eventual B-side "The Matter of Time", had been included in its place, ''Guerrilla'' would have been a much more self-indulgent album. The singer has also stated that the group's "healthy ego problems" would often result in individuals fighting to have some of their own songs removed from the final track listing of the record in favour of songs written by other members. The band chose to sequence the album like a hip hop record, with "Check It Out" as an introduction and "A Specific Ocean" and "The Sound of Life Today" as interludes.
The album's title is pun on the band's name but was also chosen by the group as they felt it had added resonance in the wake of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Rhys has also stated that the band sometimes flatter themselves that they "take a guerrilla stance outside things, make things that aren't pop, popular in the future". The band added the subtitle "Non violent direct action" to the album's packaging to ensure that no-one could read any "crass, militaristic statements" into the name of the record. The band thought about making a film to accompany the album but ultimately decided that the idea was "too ambitious". They returned to this idea with 2001's ''Rings Around the World'', making music videos for each of the tracks on the record and including them on the album's DVD release.
The ''Melody Maker'' has described opening track "Check It Out" as a "jazz funk" song which turns into dub after its first minute. The magazine went on to state that the song sums up the album due to its "defacement of symmetry" and disorder, which is also evident on "Do or Die", "The Turning Tide" and "The Teacher", all of which start as pop before ending up "skew-whiff under a wealth of hooligan noise". "The Turning Tide" features a string arrangement by High Llamas frontman Sean O'Hagan. According to Rhys the band were happy with O'Hagan's "interesting" arrangement   the track is more serious than many of the other songs on the album and the group found writing a string part for it themselves problematic. "Do or Die" has been described as a "dumb pop song" by Rhys and called "surf pop" by the ''Melody Maker''. Rhys has called "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" "metronomical", and stated that it was inspired by mobile phone ringtones. Critics have described the song as a techno track, with Pitchfork calling it "floor-slapping LSD-infused electronica" and ''Spin'' stating that it is "a psycho ward of tweaked noises", reminiscent of the music of Daft Punk.|accessdate=23 November 2010}} "The Door to This House Remains Open" is a drum and bass song that has been likened to the music of Boards of Canada by Yahoo! Music, while "Some Things Come From Nothing" is a post-punk dub track that was called "the closest a rock band will come to the cracked ambience of Aphex Twin" by the ''NME''.{{cite web|last=Poletti|first=James|title=Super Furry Animals: Guerilla |publisher=Yahoo!

"Night Vision" is the "most aggressive-sounding" song on the album according to Rhys. The track has been called garage rock by the ''Melody Maker'' and punk rock by both Allmusic and Yahoo! Music, with the latter comparing the song to "She's Lost Control" by Joy Division. First single "Northern Lites" is a calypso-inspired track. Critics have commented on the song's use of "Tijuana brass", reminiscent of the work of Herb Alpert, and likened the track to the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David and the Beck single "Deadweight".{{cite journal|first=Peter|last=Kane|title=Super Furry Animals: Guerrilla|journal=Q|publisher=EMAP|issue=July 1999|page=124}}{{cite journal|first=Cigarettes|last=Johnny|title=Singles|journal=NME|volume=|pages=43|date=8 May 1999}}{{cite journal|first=Carl|last=Loben|title=Singles|journal=Melody Maker|publisher=IPC Media|volume=|pages=39|date=May 15, 1999}}{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Marc|title=Super Furry Animals Songbook: The Singles Volume One|publisher=Pitchfork Media|date=30 January 2005|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7604-songbook-the-singles-volume-one/|accessdate=27 December 2010}}
Pete Fowler, who had designed the sleeve of every Super Furry Animals release since the 1997 single "Hermann    's Pauline", again provided the artwork for ''Guerrilla''. Fowler worked in 3D, creating a model of a yellow monster, smoking a pipe and wearing a "mobile phone and bandolier belt". The monster is shown operating "the control panel of the universe" for the cover of the record.
The album features the hidden tracks "Citizen's Band" and "Chewing Chewing Gum (Reprise)". The former appears only on the Compact Disc version of the record   it is stored in the pregap and can be heard by rewinding back from the start of the first song, "Check It Out". The latter appears at the very end of the album following several minutes of silence after the end of last song "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy". The lyrics for "Citizen's Band" are hidden inside the card outer-sleeve included with original CD copies of the album. According to Rhys the band decided to hide "Citizen's Band" as it didn't fit with the rest of the ''Guerrilla'' and they wanted to make the album like a computer game which can be played for several months before a new level is discovered. Guitarist Huw Bunford has stated that the band originally intended to hide the track in the album cover itself, by way of a special vinyl sleeve design, but the group's record label, Creation, refused to allow this due to the cost.
The ''NME'' called the album "an acid fried quadrophonic vision of rock 'n' roll" and suggested that it was a masterpiece which could define the era in which it was released, in the same way that Primal Scream's ''Screamadelica'' did in 1991 and ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' by Oasis did in 1995. The magazine also stated that, despite the very different musical genres evident on the album, it succeeds in being a coherent, startlingly beautiful record, which showcases the band's "thunderous imagination and three-dimensional vision" and could be described as "experimental music with a beating heart". The ''NME'' ranked the album at number three in their Albums of the year 1999 feature, praising the record for its "superabundance of creativity".  The ''Melody Maker'' also claimed that the album accurately reflected the era in which it was released and called it the group's best release. The magazine went on to compare ''Guerrilla'' to the "romance" of drug taking, calling it a "beautifully suggestive and inspiring testament" to illegal substances. ''Select'' placed ''Guerrilla'' at number nine in their albums of the year award for 1999 and called "Somethings Come From Nothing" the record's highlight, stating that the track "oozes an epic, sonourous electronic sadness around Gruff's muted mumbling of a single sentence". Despite dismissing "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" as a throwaway novelty song, the magazine stated that ''Guerrilla'' "makes experiment engaging" and concluded that it was a "brilliantly subversive" attack on the charts. The record appeared in the "Best New Albums of 1999" feature in the January 2000 issue of ''Record Collector'', with the magazine calling it "upbeat and mischievous, with as many touching moments as there are puzzling".}}
The Super Furry Animals embarked on a brief, five-date, tour of the United Kingdom, in support of first single "Northern Lites", beginning at Tenby De Valance Pavilion on 27 April 1999 and ending at the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 2 May. The group then played that year's Glastonbury and V festivals. The band undertook a tour of the United States and Canada, beginning at Maxwell's, Hoboken, New Jersey on 14 September and ending at the Coachella Festival on 9 October. Singer Gruff Rhys wrote a tour diary, covering the first nine dates from 14-26 September, which appeared in the 9 October 1999 issue of the ''Melody Maker'' under the title "Guerrillas in the Midwest". The group played a fifteen date tour of the United Kingdom, starting on 15 October at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool and ending at the Brixton Academy, London on 3 November. After concerts in Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and France, promotion ended with a headline date at the Cardiff International Arena on 20 December which was webcast on the band's official website, and a support slot with the Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff on New Year's Eve 1999.
Singer Gruff Rhys has described ''Guerrilla'' as "flippant, exciting, with an instant pop rush" and "one of  most ambitious" records, going on to state that "if any of our records could've sold a lot, this is the one. I don't think the others have been proper pop albums, but I think ''Guerrilla'' could have been". The band were disappointed with the relative lack of success of the album and its singles   none of which managed to chart inside the Top Ten of the UK Singles Chart   and went on "pop strike" as a result. Because of this the group's next record was the all-Welsh language, lo-fi, ''Mwng'', which the group recorded simply for the joy of making music. The album was recorded in two weeks for just , in contrast with the "excessive expense" of ''Guerrilla''.
