By the end of their sixth season in 2010, HPT produced over 150 hour-long episodes. Two one-hour episodes are filmed at each stop on the U.S. tour in casinos located in states such as Colorado, Nevada, Minnesota, Iowa, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Michigan. In every episode, commentators Fred Bevill and Chris Hanson analyze play of the final six contestants in the Main Event.  To enter the main event, poker enthusiasts either buy directly in or win their way through the qualifying system for a fraction of the investment of the widely-celebrated World Series of Poker, which commands buy ins up to $50,000. HPT's main event is typically a $1650 buy in, although it can vary by venue. Prize money is awarded to the top 10% of the field or 30 places, whichever is greater.  HPT tournaments follow rules established by the  for Texas hold 'em poker.
In January 2009, HPT announced a relationship with the nonprofit group Disabled American Veterans (DAV) to raise funds and awareness for the cause. One percent of every prize pool goes to support DAV programs, where applicable under state gaming laws.  HPT also coordinates celebrity charity poker tournaments to raise additional funds.  DAV Public Service Announcements (PSAs) air in HPT episodes weekly.
In January 2010, HPT made headlines in the poker community when the company chartered four private jets to fly two hundred poker enthusiasts to Las Vegas, Nevada for the Season VI launch of the tour.  The event attracted celebrities like actor Lou Diamond Phillips and poker pro Dennis Phillips and sold out Red Rock Casino Resort Spa.

A last minute replacement for an ill Scotty Nguyen, Moon bonded with HPT   s crew and players.
