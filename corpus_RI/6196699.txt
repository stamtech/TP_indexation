Kurtz graduated from Haverford College and holds a Ph.D. in social anthropology from Harvard University. He did his field work in India and taught at Harvard and the University of Chicago.  He has published extensively on family life, child rearing, religion, and psychology in various parts of the world.
During the 2008 election cycle, Kurtz published several editorials that discussed relationships between Barack Obama and some Chicago church leaders such as Jeremiah Wright, and former Weather Underground member Bill Ayers. According to Kurtz, the educational program on which Obama and Ayers collaborated was ultimately unsuccessful. His 2010 book ''Radical-in-Chief'' claims that President Barack Obama is a socialist.
