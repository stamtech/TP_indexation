With the help of friends and after attending a home game in Simi Valley, where the host provided cheat sheets to teach beginners how hands ranked she began to understand the game.  She knew she liked poker and that she felt comfortable with the game.
Breeze played her first tournament, the Legends of Poker Ladies Event at the Bicycle Casino in Bell Gardens, California where she coincidentally sat next to Barbara Enright who was the 1995 "Last Woman Standing" and only woman to make it to the main event final table.  When Breeze went home she Googled Barbara's name and was shocked to learn who she was. Barbara became a close friend and mentor to her.  Breeze went on to enter the 2010 Queen of Hearts tournament at the Bicycle, placing 11th. 
Preceding the World Series of Poker Main Event, she traveled to Las Vegas with her friend and business partner Howard Asher and entered the June 28, 2010 "Afternnon Deepstack at the WSOP" tournament at the RIO and placed 5th out of a field of 540 players, cashing for $5000.
