Singer is a former environmental lawyer who worked on issues and lawsuits related to cleaning up the Long Island Sound for a non-profit organization.
He has been playing poker professionally since 1996, concentrating on seven-card stud before moving to mostly Texas hold 'em tournaments. 
In October 2007, Singer won the Caesars Palace Classic $9,800 No Limit Hold'em Championship Event, winning $1,000,000.
In May 2008, Singer earned $560,000 by winning the $25,000 Full Tilt Poker Heads Up World Championship. The tournament featured 64 players in the largest buy-in in online poker history.
 His 28 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,493,368 of those winnings.
Singer has garnered considerable success in World Series of Poker play. He is the only person to make the final table of the three largest buy-in No-Limit Hold'em events in a single year at the World Series of Poker, which he did in 2003. At the 2003 series, Singer made the final table of the Main Event, busting out in ninth place. 
Singer's biggest result at the 2006 World Series of Poker was a sixth place finish in the $50,000 HORSE event, earning $411,840.  This tournament's final table was broadcast by ESPN and was one of the toughest final tables in the history of the WSOP.  It featured two world champions, Doyle Brunson and Jim Bechtel, as well as multi-bracelet winners Dewey Tomko, T. J. Cloutier, Phil Ivey, and Chip Reese who went on to win the tournament after the longest heads-up play in the history of the World Series of Poker. 
After being away from the majority of the 2007 WSOP for personal reasons, he became the first player to make back-to-back final tables in the $50,000 HORSE event, again finishing sixth.
At the 2008 World Series of Poker in the $1,500 Pot-Limit Hold'em event Singer won his first bracelet earning $214,131.
