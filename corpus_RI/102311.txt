The Town of Orange contains numerous examples of historic architecture, as well as several notable historic sites. Prior to the American Civil War, Orange was the center of commerce and justice for Orange County, Virginia, and a number of antebellum buildings survive today.
For this reason, the Orange Commercial Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1800, Paul Verdier purchased the property of William Bell, an 18th century farm that included much of the modern-day Town of Orange. Bell   s Tavern was a part of this property, which Verdier renamed the Orange Hotel. The Orange Hotel stood at the site of what is now the historic Orange Court House (constructed in 1859). In 1819, Verdier relocated his residence to a house he named Montpeliso, which is still extant.
Shortly thereafter, Verdier divided his property into town lots, creating a town layout that survives largely intact. By 1830, at least two federal-style brick structures were standing on West Main.  One is locally known as the Sparks building, and the other as the Doctor Holladay House. The oldest building in the Town of Orange is another brick structure called Spring Garden.
The Town of Orange was a strategically important location during the American Civil War.
Just north of town, the Rapidan River was effectively the northern border of the Confederacy from March 1862 to May 1864. Consequently, the area witnessed countless troop movements, patrols, skirmishes, and encampments. In addition, the Town of Orange served as General Robert E. Lee's headquarters during that time. In fact, General Lee worshipped at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church on Caroline Street, which still stands today. This church is also significant because it served as a hospital for Confederate wounded after the Battle of Chancellorsville, and the Battle of the Wilderness. Lee passed by this church many times during his stay in Orange, and Mort Kunstler, a famous artist of American historical subjects, immortalized this scene in his painting ''Soldier of Faith''.
Following the devastation to Warrenton, Virginia, during the Civil War, George Scott Shackelford moved from Warrenton to Charlottesville and later to Orange in 1881, where he was an attorney, Mayor of Orange, member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Virginia State Senate, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, and later judge of the Ninth Virginia Judicial Circuit. Shackelford married Virginia Minor Randolph, daughter of Dr. Wilson Cary Nicholas Randolph of Charlottesville, great-great-grandson of President Thomas Jefferson. Shackelford resided at his residence ''The Poplars'' outside Orange. His descendants also lived at ''Willow Grove'' plantation, two miles from Orange. The Shackelford family later took an active role in the Monticello Association.
The town continued to thrive into the twentieth century.  Fire destroyed much of the eastern part of town in 1908, but many of the buildings constructed shortly after the fire still remain. In fact, Orange was well-known for its silk mill, which produced many of the parachutes used by U.S. troops during World War 2. The silk mill finally closed in the 1970s, but the building still remains and is used by local businesses, including a restaurant.
