The '''Juglandaceae''', also known as the Walnut Family, is a family of trees, or sometimes shrubs, in the order Fagales.  Various members of this family are native to the Americas, Eurasia, and Southeast Asia.
Members of the walnut family have large aromatic leaves, that are usually alternate, but opposite in ''Alfaroa'', ''Oreomunnia''.  The leaves are pinnately compound, or ternate, and usually 20   100&nbsp;cm long.
The trees are wind-pollinated, and the flowers usually arranged in catkins. 
There are eight genera in the family, including the commercially important nut-producing trees walnut (''Juglans''), pecan (''Carya illinoinensis''), and hickory (''Carya'').  The Persian walnut, ''Juglans regia'', is one of the major nut crops of the world.  Walnut, hickory, and gaulin are also valuable timber trees.
The known living genera are grouped into subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes as follows:
Subfamily Engelhardioideae
Subfamily Juglandoideae
The only member of the genus ''Alfaropsis'' I.A.Iljinsk., ''Alfaropsis roxburghiana'' (Wall.) I.A.Iljinsk. is a synonym for ''Engelhardia roxburghiana'' Wall. (or perhaps vice-versa).
The only member of the genus ''Annamocarya'' A.Chev., ''Annamocarya sinensis'' (Dode) J.-F.Leroy, may actually be a member of ''Carya'', and belongs in the subtribe Caryinae.
Some fruits are borderline and difficult to categorize.  Hickory nuts (Carya) and Walnuts (Juglans) in the Juglandaceae family grow within an outer husk; these fruits are technically drupes or drupaceous nuts, and thus not true botanical nuts.  ''Tryma'' is a specialized term for such nut-like drupes.
