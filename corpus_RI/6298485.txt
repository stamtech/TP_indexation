Greetings. I am looking for 2d stealth games for the PC, the likes of which I have yet to encounter in a two dimensional world. The closest approximations I can think of are Splinter Cell and Thief; Are there any games that you folks can think of off the top of your heads that are not entirely dissimilar in gamesply style?

According to the page on Concentration (game), it's variously known as "Memory" / "Concentration" / "Pelmanism"     what I need to know is how these names are currently distributed across the English speaking globe. I posted a query on the Talk page for the article; would appreciate answers here or   ''-- Thanks,   ( ) 07:17, 26 April 2008 (UTC)''
Thanks to all for your responses, which I've posted on the   for the game. ''-- Cheers,   ( ) 10:44, 2 May 2008 (UTC)''
Its appears there may be more to Microsoft's desire to buyout Yahoo. Windows Media Player versus Yahoo's Music Jukebox. My new RCA player can use either to convert and load music files but more importantly both provide access to online stores so in reality it looks like Microsoft's real interest in Yahoo is to eliminate one source of competition. I can think of several reasons why I am against such a merger. Are there others?    ( ) 08:15, 26 April 2008 (UTC) 
I was wondering how people record their screens while playing their xbox/playstation. Is there a recording feature built in? or what? I know it's not from a camera recording the tv, because the quality is great.     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 15:01, 26 April 2008 (UTC) 
I am looking for the song lyrics for an old possibly classical OR BROADWAY SHOW song.
Some of the lyrics are as follows: "LET THERE BE MUSIC, FROM THE FRUITED PLAIN, WITH MUSIC FROM THE HEART, MUSIC FROM THE AZSURE SKY, OVER A PEACEFUL LAND"...
IF SO, CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH THE COMPLETE LYRICS?     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 19:31, 26 April 2008 (UTC) 
The information you are looking for is from a song titled "Let There Be Music - Hymn to America"
Harold Flammer Choral Series. Copyright 1949, by Harold Flammer, Inc.
Music by Frances Williams. Words by Marjorie Elliott. It is a beautiful song.
I lived in Hawaii for some time recently back in 07, and there is this song that i liked alot its a slow song but i cant seem to remember the name or the artist. I know part of the lyrics but no lyric search engine can ever find the song, so i figured i ask here. Some of the lyrics are "give me the grind give me the morning grind, anything you want me to, ill abide." And there is a part i remember that goes like this "its a shame for me to unbutton your dress". Thats all i can remember. Its a slow type or reggae or Hawaiian style music. Thanks for any effort given to help me find the song! --  ( ) 21:20, 26 April 2008 (UTC)

Is true that in ''Casino Royale'', the James Bond theme wasn't used until the end of the film, and which version of the Bond theme is played during the end credits?   ( ) 21:38, 26 April 2008 (UTC)
