Mitchell Campbell King was the son of teacher, Lawyer and Judge Mitchel King (Kingo) (b. 8 June 1783 in Crail, Fife, Scotland; d. 12 November 1862 in Charleston) and his first wife Susanna Campbell (b. 1788 in Scotland; d. before 1830 in the Carolinas). King headed to South Carolina in 1810 and both married on 23 February 1811 in Charleston. They had seven children. Mitchell C. King was the second oldest and with him began the family tradition in using his mothers maiden name Campbell in remembrance of the families Scottish heritage. He studied medicine at the Charleston Medical College and Gottingen University, Germany. In Gottingen he was friends with Amory Coffin (1813   1884) and John Lothrop Motley, the three of them became friends with the later German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck there in 1832, and both, Bismarck and King joined Corps Hannovera Gottingen, a German Student Corps committed to academic fencing, as fellows. Mitchell C. King finished his medical education with an M.D. from Charleston Medical College and settled on one of the family's farms in South Carolina and Georgia. In the summer time the King family lived in the mountains of Flat Rock in the western part of North Carolina. Later in his life he concentrated on practicing as a physician in Henderson County. He had correspondence with Bismarck until 1875 and Bismarcks letters to him are preserved in the Library of Congress while some of Kings letters are kept by the Otto-von-Bismarck-Stiftung in Friedrichsruh near Hamburg, which is a commemorative German Government Foundation in the memory of the Chancellor of the German Empire like the Presidential libraries in the United States.
Mitchell C. King married Elizabeth Laura Middleton (b. 27. April 1820 in Charleston; d. on 15 February 1838) in Charleston. They had eleven children.
