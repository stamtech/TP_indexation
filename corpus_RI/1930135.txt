On August 15, 2006 WHOT became the first station in Eastern Ohio to broadcast in HD.
The connection between the WHOT callsign and the Top 40/CHR format is one of the longest running in modern radio history, dating back to 1955. WHOT is one of the first Top 40 stations in the country, as an daytime-only signal licensed to Campbell, Ohio on the 1570 kHz facility (currently home to the Warren, Ohio-licensed WHTX). Despite its technical limitations, the station attained high ratings in the Youngstown, Ohio market, which has lasted after frequency moves; first to 1330 kHz in 1963 (now WGFT), then to 1390 kHz (now WNIO) in 1990.
By 1991, the AM and FM stations broke into separate programming with the 1390&nbsp;kHz facility taking an adult standards format (one that would be revisited in 1999 when WNIO's call letters and format moved to that dial position), while the 101.1&nbsp;MHz taking the Top 40 format. Excluding a period of several months when WHOT-FM carried a rock music format in late 1991-early 1992, the station has since continued with a Top 40/CHR format.
Since 1995, the WHOT calls has existed exclusively on the FM dial. Prior to becoming WHOT-FM on February 1, 1984, the station used the call letters WSRD. WSRD, nicknamed "The Wizard", featured an Album-oriented rock format that was established back in the late 1970s.  Known for many years as HOT-FM 101, the branding was changed to HOT-101 in the 1990s.
