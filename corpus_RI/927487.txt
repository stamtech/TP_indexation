This stop was originally named '''Massachusetts'''. It was renamed to '''Auditorium''' in 1965 and to '''Hynes Convention Center/ICA''' in 1990. In November 2006, shortly after the Institute of Contemporary Art relocated from its nearby location on Boylston Street to a new building near the Courthouse station on the waterfront branch of the Silver Line, the letters "ICA" were removed from all signboards in the station. There are still some old maps in certain MBTA stations that refer to this station as Auditorium; additionally, the inspection certificate on the escalator has "Auditorium Station" as its address.
The entrance closest to the Hynes Convention Center (on Boylston Street) is closed (except on Patriot's Day, to handle the spectators from the Boston Marathon). People wishing to access the Hynes Convention Center or the Prudential Center must exit onto Massachusetts Avenue and walk to Boylston Street.
Hynes received the new CharlieCard automated fare system in September 2006.  The new fare equipment was also installed at the closed-off station entrance, but it is unknown whether or not this entrance will re-open.
This station is not wheelchair accessible.
