After the local government elections of 2006, a coalition was formed by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Independent Democrats (ID), and Charmaine Manuel of the ANC was elected as executive mayor with Wilhelm Nothnagel of the ID as deputy mayor. In April of 2007 the ID broke the coalition, and formed a new coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA); Koos Louw of the DA was elected mayor while Nothnagel remained deputy mayor. During the floor crossing period in September 2007, seven councillors (five from the ID, including Nothnagel) defected to the ANC, giving the ANC an outright majority (32 of 61 seats) on the council. Charmaine Manuel was re-elected as mayor, with Nothnagel continuing as deputy.
In the 2011 local government elections the DA managed to turn the tables, and obtained an outright majority on the council, holding 35 seats out of 61.
