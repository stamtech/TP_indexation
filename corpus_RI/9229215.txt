Plans to build a new high school in Pine Hills began in the early 1950s. Until then, students in Pine Hills were bussed to Edgewater High School, Apopka High School and, to a lesser extent, Winter Park High School. Evans High opened in 1955 and was officially named "Maynard Evans High School" in 1956. It was named in honor of a local pharmacist, Maynard Evans, who owned a pharmacy and soda shop in downtown Orlando named "Evans Pharmacy".
Evans High was built during the height of segregation and it wasn't until 1972 when the school was finally desegregated.
During the 1960s and into the 1970s, the campus grew to include a gymnasium, media center, auditorium, and a stadium shared by Edgewater High School named the "Double E Stadium".
In the 1980s up until the mid-1990s, Evans High was one of the largest schools in Orange County. The student population peaked at 4,500 and in 1993 the 9th Grade Center opened 3 miles to the west of the main campus.
By 2005, declining conditions on the main campus proved detrimental to the students' education. The Orange County school board planned to build a new $37million school on board owned land adjacent to the 9th Grade Center Campus. This plan was met with fierce opposition by the mayor of Ocoee and nearby residents; prompting the Orange County Board of County Commissioners to reject the school board's plan in 2008. The school board thus decided to build a new school on the main campus at a cost of $75million.
In the 2007-2008 school year, the racial makeup of the Evans student body is: 84% Black, 9% Hispanic, 3% White, and 2% Asian/Pacific Islander. (''Source: FL Dept. of Education, 2007-2008'')
Evans High School has the largest percentage of Haitian students in Orlando.
Evans High's current rival is Jones High School. Football games between the schools are called "The Soul Bowl".
Evans High School's football team were the 1991 Class 5A State Champions, where they tied with Southridge High School in Miami, Florida.
Evans High also features baseball, basketball, volleyball, tennis, track, and swim teams.
Evans High School's marching band is called "The Green Machine" and their motto is "The Best Band in the Land". As of the 2009-2010 school year, The Green Machine is under the direction of Mr. Melvin Wright.
Dear Alma Mater,
We shall lift our voices,
Singing thy praises,
Ever through the years,
We'll not forget thee,
When afar we wander,
Sharing fond memories of,
Evans High!
