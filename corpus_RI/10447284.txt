We have the page Octuple champion, then this page, and the page Manny Pacquiao. The first explains whatever an octuple champion is, and the last focuses on the sole octuple champion there is. The List, however, is a 14K page listing 7 times the achievements of Pacquiao, and nothing else. There are no octuple champion'''s''', there is only one such, so there is no ''list'' either. Attempts by multiple editors, including myself, to redirect this list to the Pacquaio article, as a compromise, where reverted each time (5 times so far). Talk page discussion hasn't achieved anything either. Basically, this is as it stands a duplicative page of Manny Pacquaio and octuple champion, and wuold be in any case an unlikely redirect as well, so I don't see much purpose in keeping the redirect either, but I prefer, if it comes to that, the redirect very, very clearly above a separate article.

Defining the word "list" with EVEN one item or person on it, clearly separates 'ONE' unique and superlatively one record achievement segregating that item amongst all "lists" of achievements surmountably gained by that person extremely regarded as world-acclaimed considerably treating it as "one in a billion feat amongst earth's inhabitants" super as it does unbelievable, IS ONE GOOD REASON ABOVE ALL that this page list of "List of Boxing Octuple Champions" MUST NOT, BY AND THROUGH A CRYSTAL-CLEAR ACHIEVEMENT - BE REMOVED, DELETED OR REDIRECTED.  The fact that a previous "Septuplet List of Boxing Champions" was created having 2 world-acclaimed persons in it, DOES NOT DIFFER IN ANY MEANS OR IN ANY ANGLE POSED ANY GOOD REASON TO DELETE the list, "List of Octuplet Boxing Champions".
This would take us all TO PONDER and PUT A HUGE QUESTION MARK ON OUR HEADS to justify NOT DELETING this quite essential WIKI "List of Octuplet Boxing Champions" distinct and separate from all 7 lists existing, start to ask yourselves this equation-question:
As a support to my previous argument, "NOT TO DELETE" this "List of Octuple Boxing Champions" page at Wiki's, firstly, to vouch and certify my stand and position, my valid yahoo account is: jmacmert@yahoo.com; and im connected with NCB Capital, an investment bank in Jeddah, KSA with which anyone can validly email me at: m.macaranas@ncbc.com, or contact at: +966-551-348251.
My only plead and humble contention NOT TO DELETE this one page "List of Octuple Boxing Champions" is, NOT THAT, I AM A FILIPINO and a COMPATRIOT OF Manny Pacman Pacquiao BY RACE, BUT BY SOLE AND SIMPLE REASON THAT - "a feat, equivalent to almost a lifetime, or at the most - a century period of time for all of us humans to wait, whose average capability at one speciality extraordinarily achieved - is limited to a normal achievement, as to live and co-exist with co-humans as normal as we are. This recent ONE FEAT ACHIEVEMENT THAT IS YET TO BE DUPLICATED ON FUTURE PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY - is definitely quite deserving of a distinct, 1 full exclusive page of decent, respect, and special recognition of that "extra-ordinary" human achievement in this era, moreover in our lifetime.
To reiterate on my other position and stand, WE CAN NEVER EVER BE GIVEN ANOTHER SUCH SIMILAR FEAT TRULY a GOD-SPECIAL GIVEN SKILL TO ATTAIN SUCH EXTRA HEIGHTS OF INGENUITY, maybe by tommorow, next month, next year, next decade or the next century - OR WE CAN NEVER EVER TELL THE TIME. Thus, please, i beg u all to be considerate and fair enough on this very special moment in time of our lives where one impossible feat has been achieved, the fact that to even co-exist with this extra-ordinary ATHLETE IS CONSIDERED, ONE BEST SPECIAL GIFT GOD HAS GIVEN US IN THIS UNPARALLELED era, a one-hardest feat has been remarkably reached for the last 80 years, or at the time immemorial of boxing history in our own time - the 21st century's early period.
Think about it - are we REASONABLE ENOUGH IF WE WONT ALLOW THIS PAGE TO FLUORISH TRIUMPHANTLY IN RESPECT OF THAT MAN, supposedly deserving full screen page for even 20KB space equivalent, in respect of what has been achieved at its incredible manner?
On other contentions, would it be nice and wonderful, then, that WIKI team prepared it now, THAN WAIT FOR THE 2ND MAN TO DO THE SAME FEAT, on uncertainty of another time, then re-create it later?
WHICH ACTION THEN FOR YOU IS ABOUNDING WITH A VIVID AND A CRYSTAL-CLEAR UNSELFISHNESS TO TREAT ONE WITH NICE AND WONDERFUL ACTION AND GESTURE TO PROVIDE HIM WITH RECOGNITION AND FULL DISPLAY OF WHAT, WHO, WHERE, HOW, WHEN, WHY INFORMATIVE-PROVIDING CONJUNCTIONS FOR MANKIND TO KNOW? at this point in time ur life? DELETE OR NOT TO DELETE, let thine modern-civilized conscience, "simple" as it is be put over and above the rest of the best of the olden times, when the world was as young as the great writers of medieval, roman times where "gladiators" only destination for formidability, super-agility and fame - ENDS BY A DEATH OF CO-GLADIATORS... how come we know NOT OF EVEN ONE OF THEM TODAY?
Wiki it now, today and further, lest we be put to regret and blame for only the simplest thing and action we will put today against our grandsons and daughters in century's to come, i beg u all, PLEASE DO NOT DELETE AND PROCEED TO PUBLISH UNCHALLENGED, AN ACT OF FAIR AND TRUE MISSIONARY VISION OF PROPAGATING HONESTY, TRUTH, BALANCED AND EQUALITY IN FOOTING FOUNDATION OF INFORMATION AND RECOGNITION OF THOSE DESERVING.
Lastly, i am a valid account yahoo user and an avid Yahoo Answers Boxing Section blogger-contributor with a Y/Answers handle as: junMjeddahKSA, and currently employed as a contractor-staff at National Commercial Bank Capital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (an investment bank)
Respectfully submitted with full arguments and position NOT TO DELETE THIS ESSENTIAL PAGE,
