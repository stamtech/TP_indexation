In the early 1970s, a marinized version of their 2.0 litre 4 cylinder gasoline engine was marketed as the Model # 410 and # 411. In 1977 finally established a separate marine division with the incorporation of BMW Marine GmbH. BMW Marine's head office and assembly plant was located in Verviers, Belgium.
From BMW's automotive engine production came the 2.0 litre four cylinder M10 engine. This was marinized, creating the new B 130. The M30 six cylinder engines in 2.8 and 3.3 litre variations, then became the B 190 and B 220 models. The model numbers related to the engine's horsepower. Later the larger 3.5 litre M30 with electronic ignition became the B 635.
Then, BMW,in conjunction with ZF, designed and manufactured a new stern drive unit. These stern drives were marketed as the BMW 'Z-Drive'. Uniquely, these stern drives utilized a multiple wet clutch system. With these drives, BMW now offered an engine/drive package to compete with Sweden's Volvo Penta and Mercury Marine's Mercruiser Division of Stillwater, Oklahoma.
To further compete with Volvo Penta, BMW added small auxiliary sail boat diesel propulsion engines ranging from 7 to 50 horsepower. Based on four air cooled diesel engines manufactured by Motorenfabrik Hatz GmbH + Co. KG. BMW's engineers marinized these engines, then added Hurth Marine transmissions and instrument panels and these became their popular D 7, D 12, D 35 and D 50 engines. Ahead of their time, the BMWs offered 'balance shaft technology' which made for a smoother running engine. Later, to reduce the corrosion damage from salt water cooling, BMW modified the two larger models which became their D 35-2 and D 50-2. Many of these auxiliary engines found there way into both racing and cruising sail boats made by companies such as S2, Pearson, Jonmeri, Hans Christian. Custom yacht builders such as Lyman Morse in the USA also installed BMW marine engines in their boats.
To round out their marine engine package, BMW needed a large diesel, especially for the European power boat market. BMW went south from Munich to VM Motori in neighbouring Northern Italy. The VM HR.H 692 block became the basis for these engines. This engine is unusual in that it incorporates the crankshaft inside the crankcase. Most gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines manufactured today bolt the crankshaft onto the bottom of the crankcase. This type of construction, often seen in racing car engines, is referred to as a 'tunnel bore' block. It was also used in the Maybach MD870 diesel engine.
BMW designed and manufactured thousands of special marine parts for the VM tunnel bore blocks. With 150 HP these turbocharged engines became BMW Marine's D 150 W and D 150 Z models. A 190 HP turbocharged and intercooled D 190 was also available. The D 150 and D190 diesel engines were sold with either a Hurth 360 transmission for inboard installation or the BMW Z-Drive for stern drive applications. The D190 was later re-engineered, and with a modified Mark II Z-Drive, was sold as the BMW D 636 Z. Following this a five cylinder 3.0 litre version of the 3.6 litre six was offered as the BMW D 530. In England, Fairline and Plancraft offered their products with BMW Power. In America, Ken Hopen's GlasPly plant in Washington state featured both BMW gasoline and diesel engines with BMW Z-Drives in his product line.
With a downturn in the automotive market in 1987, and a lack of significant success in the recreational marine market, BMW decided to close the marine division. The Belgium plant and assets were sold to Mercury Marine of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. BMW further signed a parts distribution agreement with Mercury for the continued supply of parts to the 1,000's of BMW marine engine owners in the world.
Mercury continued production of the BMW five and six cylinder diesel engines. The BMW D 530 and D 636 became the Mercruiser 530 D-TA and 636 D-TA. Mercury later changed the designations to D183 and D219 TURBO AC.
Mercury continued where BMW had left off, improving on these VM based engines. In the early 1990s they offered a larger 4.2 litre diesel designated the D254 Turbo AC. The designation '254' related to the displacement of the engine in cubic inches. As of 2008, variations of the original 3.6 litre engines became the Mercruiser D4.2L/220 IDI six cylinder diesel.
Parts for BMW Marine engines continue to be available from Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac and their subsidiary Marine Power in Belgium.
Of the original 200 BMW marine dealers worldwide, a handful continue to service and sell part. In Europe, two prominent ones are Solberg Motors Ltd. in Sandefjord, Norway and Franz Maier in Germany. Beginning in 2000, utilizing the internet, V12 Engineering began selling parts to BMW Marine customers worldwide. V12 Engineering deals exclusively in BMW Marine products. In 2007 BMW Munich appointed V12 Engineering as a BMW dealer.
