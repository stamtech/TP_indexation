Smadi was in the United States illegally, and unaware he was under continuous surveillance, and that the other members of his "sleeper cell" were all Federal agents. The agents in his "sleeper cell" had supplied him with inert chemical, so his bomb had not posed a real threat.
Immigration officials were trying to determine how Smadi was able to work at a gas station, since he only had a 2007 tourist visa.
Smadi admitted leaving what he thought was a truck bomb in a garage beneath the 60-story building September. The device was a dud provided by FBI agents posing as al-Qaeda members.  Smadi activated a timer connected to the decoy with a cell phone, then rode with an undercover agent and waited to watch the explosion.  Instead, the phone rang an FBI number, and Smadi was arrested.
Smadi agreed to plead guilty to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. The charge is punishable by up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine, but prosecutors agreed to suggest to U.S. District Judge Barbara M. Lynn that the sentence not be more than 30 years.  Under the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped a charge accusing Smadi of bombing a public place.
