Shorr is notable for his success in poker tournaments, much of which occurred before his 21st birthday. Because 21 is the minimum legal age for gambling in almost all jurisdictions in the United States, Shorr was forced to go abroad to compete, where he cashed in several tournaments. He scored his first major payday with a fourth-place finish at the 2006 Aussie Millions tournament in Melbourne, Australia, where he won more than $200,000. During much of this time, Shorr was a civil engineering student at the University of Alabama.
In his first domestic tournaments, Shorr had second- and third-place finishes in a World Series of Poker circuit event in Lake Tahoe, then cashed in three tournaments at the WSOP itself, finishing 577th and winning more than $20,000 in the main event. But while he was in Las Vegas for the WSOP, Shorr also took part in the Bellagio Cup II at the Bellagio Casino, and had much greater success     a win at an undercard no limit Texas hold 'em event worth $126,585, two more top-30 finishes, and then a victory in the main event with a top prize of just under a million dollars (though Shorr's actual winnings were in the neighborhood of $600,000 after cutting a deal with the other two remaining players, a frequent practice at big-money tournaments).
The Bellagio Cup win moved Shorr into third place in the Card Player Magazine Player of the Year rankings. Shorr ended the year in fourth place, and was ranked 91st in the Bluff Magazine Power Rankings.
In the 2007 World Series of Poker, Shorr advanced to the quarterfinals     the equivalent of a final table finish     in the $5,000 World Championship Heads Up No-Limit Hold 'Em event, the first time the event has been played at the WSOP. He lost to Vanessa Selbst, but pocketed $46,060. He has also cashed in a $1,000 no-limit Hold 'Em with rebuys event, finishing 56th out of 814 players and a $1,500 no-limit Hold 'Em tournament, finishing 73rd out of 3151 players.
In the 2008 World Series of Poker, Shorr finished runner-up to Matt Keikoan at the $2000 No Limit Holdem tournament (event #7), earning $349,141. It is Shorr's best finish to date at the WSOP.
In July 2008, Shannon won a $3000 Bellagio Cup preliminary event for $247,555. Just three days later he found himself at the final table of a $5000 preliminary event in the same series. This time he took 3rd place to eventual winner Jimmy Fricke. Shannon banked $125,000 for this finish.
In April 2009, Shorr finished 5th in the World Poker Tour Championship. This was Shorr's first career WPT final table, and the finish was worth $408,550. Shannon admittedly missed a week's worth of college classes to participate in the tournament.
As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $3,400,000. His 18 cashes at the WSOP account for $607,803 of those winnings.
Shorr returned to the University of Alabama for the fall semester of 2008 and stated in his blog that he received a 3.73 and 3.33 GPA for the Fall 2008 and Spring 2009 semesters. He was graduated in 2010.
