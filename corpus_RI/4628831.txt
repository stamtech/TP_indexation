The '''Northern Counties Palatine''' is a step-entrance double-decker bus body built by Northern Counties of Wigan, UK. It was built mainly on Leyland Olympian and Volvo Olympian chassis, although some were also built on DAF, Volvo B10M Citybus and Scania chassis. Two variants existed, the '''Palatine I''' (known as "Palatine" before 1992) which had a flatter windscreen, and the '''Palatine II''' (launched in 1993) which had a curved windscreen resembling that of the single-decker Northern Counties Paladin.
MTL were a notable buyer, a batch of high-specification Palatine IIs entered service in 1996 on the 'Cross River' services through the Mersey Tunnels. Another batch of 22, branded as 'The Millennium Fleet' began operating on Merseyside in 1998.
It was superseded by the Plaxton President body.
