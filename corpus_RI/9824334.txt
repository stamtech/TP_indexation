Medic Mobile completed analysis of impact after six months of its pilot at St. Gabriel   s
Hospital in rural Malawi. As a result of the project, the hospital now responds to requests for remote patient care, tracks distant patients, informs community health workers of proper drug dosages and uses, receives patient updates, connects HIV positive patients to support groups, and relays outreach HIV testing schedules.
In six months, the SMS program saved the hospital staff 1200 hours of follow-up time and over
900 hours of travel time, eliminating the need to hand-deliver paper reports.
CelloPhone is a diagnostic tool currently being developed by Aydogan Ozcan at the University of California, Los Angeles that will be able to perform basic diagnostics such as Complete Blood Count, diagnosis of Malaria and TB, and CD4 T Lymphocyte count on the back of a camera cell phone, for under $1 per test. The device itself is expected to cost as little as $10. The device utilizes a new imaging technique called LUCAS, which circumvents a lens for magnification, instead taking intracellular    holograph    images of cells directly via the CCD chip ubiquitous in most camera phones. A pattern matching algorithm then analyzes cell morphology to automatically produce a diagnostic result. The diagnostic results will be communicated from the device to a central location using FrontlineSMS, and viewed with our Patient View module and/or sent to OpenMRS through the Medic medical records module.
