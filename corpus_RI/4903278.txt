Faville, a Republican, served as the first Lieutenant Governor of Iowa from 1858 to 1860 under fellow Republican, Governor Ralph P. Lowe. He was also later an Iowa superintendent of public instruction (1864   1867). He was the last Secretary of the State Board of Education when it was changed to Supt of Public Instruction, and then was the first Supt of P I, though the two offices were essentially the same.  He was the first Co Judge of Mitchell Co, Iowa in 1851.  The Co Judge ran the county like the Board of Supervisors does today.
He was born at Mannheim, Herkimer Co, New York, great-grandson of Captain John Faville, shown on the Continental Rolls as in command at Fishkill, New York, during the American Revolution.  Faville was educated at Wesleyan University.  He then taught school in New York and Vermont.  Later he was a professor at McKendree College and the president of the Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Delaware, Ohio.  In the 1850s he moved to Mitchell County Iowa and entered politics.
After his death he was interred at Oak Grove Cemetery (Mitchell County, Iowa). His brothers are buried at Mitchell, including Minor S Faville, by great-grandfather. Oran retired to Waverly, Bremer Co, Iowa, and is buried there with his wife, and his aged mother in the local Cemetery.
