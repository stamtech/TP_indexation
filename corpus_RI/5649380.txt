USITT heads up a conference annually since 1961.  The conference focuses on various workshops, that help educate attendees on several aspects of theatre.  They also have a stage expo, in which companies showcase their products to the individuals attending the conference.  There are also many opportunities for students to show their portfolios for review, and to get a look at programs offered by universities and colleges around the country.
The members of the Institute have created a number of projects that have had a lasting impact upon the industry.
USITT sponsors the annual Young Designers and Technicians Awards recognizing the finest young people in the industry.
