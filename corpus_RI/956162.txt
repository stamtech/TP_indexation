The '''Volvo PV800 Series''' (affectionately known as '''Volvo-suggan''' or the ''Sow'') was a taxicab manufactured by Volvo between 1938 and 1958. The Sow dominated the Swedish taxicab market during the 1940s and 1950s.
The '''PV801''' (with a glass division between the front and rear seat) and the '''PV802''' (without the glass division) were introduced in 1938 and superseded the TR670 Series. The chassis and body were all new but the side-valve engine was the same as in the older cars. The front end was also used on Volvo   s smallest lorry, the LV100 Series.
The PV802 could be used as a spare ambulance. After folding all seats on the car   s right side, a stretcher could be loaded trough the bootlid. Volvo continued to build commercial chassis versions, which were often used as basis for proper ambulances.
During the Second World War Volvo built a four-wheel drive off-road vehicle, called ''Terrangpersonvagn m/43'' (TPV), for the Swedish Armed Forces. The mechanical parts were based on Volvo   s smaller lorries and the body came from the Sow.
In 1947 the PV800 was succeeded by '''PV821''' and '''PV822'''. The cars were updated with the slightly stronger ED engine and the column-mounted gear lever from Volvo PV 60.
In the autumn of 1950 the model returned with a new front, similar to the front of the PV444 and the small lorry L340. The cars were renamed '''PV831''' and '''PV832''', respectively. In 1953 independent front suspension became optional. That same year, a civilian executive version, '''Disponent''', saw the light of day.
By the end of the 1950s the Sow was quite outdated. Volvo planned for a successor, project P358, which was to be a large car powered by a V8, but that car never materialized, so when production of the PV800 Series ended in 1958 Volvo left the taxi market unattended. The recently introduced P120 Amazon was too small to serve as a taxicab and there were almost ten years before Volvo presented a new car, suitable for taxi use, the 144.
In 1953 Volvo introduced  a successor to the TPV for the armed forces, the four-wheel drive
