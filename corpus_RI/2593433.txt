It was painted with black and white panels so it was more visible on black-and-white television. The name Telstar came from one of the first communications satellites, which was roughly spherical and dotted with solar panels, somewhat similar in appearance to the football.
It was the first World Cup ball to use the truncated icosahedron or bucky ball for its design, consisting of 12 black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels, which later became the regular design of a football. Older balls had consisted of groups of stripes, similar to the configuration of the modern volleyball.
Although made of leather, it still had relative water resistant qualities provided by its shiny durlast coating. '''Durlast''' is a polyurethane coating that protects the ball from damage such as scuffs and tears. 
The Telstar is considered a ''design classic''. Although most footballs in actual use today look different, depictions of footballs in drawings such as comic books and caricatures, as well as decorative imitations of footballs, are usually still made in the Telstar look, testifying to its enduring appeal.
