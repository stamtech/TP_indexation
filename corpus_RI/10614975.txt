 The current plan is that the West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center would be torn down and replaced at a cost of $350 million. Following this, construction of a 64,000 seat retractable roof stadium would begin over the 15 acre site. AEG would expect to begin construction of the stadium by 2012 and be completed by 2015, hoping to coincide with the 50th edition of the National Football League's (NFL) Super Bowl in 2016. Though the stadium itself would be financed by AEG, the company hopes to pay for the replacement of the convention center with city bonds which would be repaid depending on tax revenue generated by the proposed stadium from hosted events.http://www.sgvbj.com/2010/11/la-stadium-varsity-vs-the-frosh/ Casey Wasserman and Tim Leiweke have investigated the probability of building a stadium behind Staples Center, where the West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center now sits. It is suggested as a possible venue for Super Bowls and NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships.Sam Farmer, , ''Los Angeles Times'', April 15, 2010 In early December 2010, Magic Johnson announced his partnership with AEG's proposal after selling his minority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers National Basketball Association (NBA) team and multiple Starbucks coffeehouse locations.Vincent Bonsignore, , ''Los Angeles Daily News'', December 1, 2010
 The feasibility of constructing a 89,000 (expandable to 105,000 for special events--i.e. Super Bowl) seat retractable roof stadium at the announced cost came into question when compared to the two newest facilities of the NFL, the new Cowboys Stadium and the New Meadowlands Stadium which were built at a cost of $1.3 and $1.6 billion respectively.  Shortly after Leiweke set a formal timeline for the proposed project that now totaled around $1 billion in costs.</ref> In December, three architectural renderings from an original field of nine design firms were revealed.<ref name="espn"></ref> During the same month Leiweke set a deadline of March 2011, anticipating a cleared negotiation with Los Angeles over control of the current convention center and ownership of the land and an agreement with the NFL over the likelihood of a team moving to Los Angeles.<ref name="team"/> The deadline has been met with criticism from media outlets including Yahoo!

On February 1, 2011, it was announced that Farmers Insurance Group had signed a 30-year, $700 million naming rights deal for the stadium, meaning the stadium would be called '''Farmers Field'''.http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nfl/news/story?id=6078709
In a February 2011 story published by InsuranceQuotes.com, Farmers emphasized that its naming rights agreement would be spread out over 30 years and that it could walk away from the deal if the Los Angeles stadium isn   t completed.    While we have every confidence that this project will get done, if it does not materialize, Farmers Insurance will pay no money for the project,    said Mark Toohey, senior vice president at Farmers.http://www.insurancequotes.com/insurance-farmers-field/
In an open blog to the public on February 15, 2011 in relation to the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations with the NFL Player's Association, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell expressed a desire to return the NFL to Los Angeles.  He named Los Angeles first in listing cities that needed new NFL stadiums.  He wrote,    The status quo means failing to recognize the many costs of financing, building, maintaining and operating stadiums. We need new stadiums in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland and San Diego.   
On March 25, 2011, Gensler was selected by AEG to design proposed $1 billion football stadium
Competing with AEG's plan is Majestic Realty Chairman and CEO Edward P. Roski's proposal in Industry, California.http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/sports/Big_Name_Guest_-__Ed_Roski_Los_Angeles-112166909.html After assessing multiple sites in Los Angeles County, the proposal settled on Industry over the available land to develop and its location to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The currently titled Los Angeles Stadium is part of a 600 acre entertainment and retail development, which will include concert halls, hotels, retail and convention space in addition to 25,000 on-site parking spaces. Following two Environmental Impact Reports (EIR) being finalized in 2009, the privately financed project is cleared to begin construction pending the resolution of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement dispute with the Player's Association. Roski had previously partnered with AEG in the development and construction of Staples Center in 1999 and again in 2002 for AEG's first stadium proposal on the current location of its 2010 proposal. That proposal fell through and was cancelled when it was deemed unsuitable by the NFL due to the lack of ample real estate to construct adequate parking facilities.
