In the early 1950s Volvo got an order to develop a new utility vehicle for the Swedish Army. A pre-run series of 90 vehicles, named L2304 was delivered between 1959 and 1961. It was powered by the Volvo B16 engine. In 1963 full scale deliveries of the somewhat improved 
L3314 begun. The L3314 was powered by the 1.8L B18.
The L33-series was offered in different body-variants such as hard-top, half-cab, soft-top, or special versions, mounting anti-tank weapons. All cars are forward control except the open L3304.
The base version was L3314SU, soft top. Other versions was L3314HT with hardtop and mechanical winch, L3304 anti-tank gun car and L3315 communications with shielded 24V system.
In the late 1970s the L3314 was succeeded by the Volvo C303.
In 1977 an upgraded version of the L3314 was offered on the civilian market as the '''C202'''. It was a hard-top with the stronger B20 engine instead of the B18 but weaker axles and no differential brake.
The C202 was manufactured in Hungary as a cheaper alternative to the rather expensive C303. Civilian versions of the L3314 series, as well as the C202, are often called the Volvo Laplander.
The L3314SU was adopted by the Swedish Army in 1959 as the '''Personlastterrangbil 903''' (Pltgb 903) and the L3314HT as the Pltgb 903B. The hard-top L3315 communications and command version was named '''Radiopersonterrangbil 9033''' (Raptgb 9033). (The L3315 was soon nicknamed "Valp", meaning "puppy", from its clumsy looks.) The L3304 low profile open bodywork version was called '''Pansarvarnspjasterrangbil 9031''' (Pvpjtgb 9031) and armed with the Pvpj 1110 9cm recoil-less antitank gun. The Swedish Army also used a few half-cabs, designated '''Pansarvarnsrobotterrangbil 9032''' (Pvrbtgb 9032), fitted with the Bofors Bantam ATGM.
There were some deliveries of a version for fire fighting, called '''Brandterrangbil 921'''. These could be connected to a trailer powered from a power take-off at the rear of the vehicle.
The Norwegian Army adopted a version called L3314N with a fold-down windscreen and 24 volt electrical system to comply with NATO regulations. About 2000 cars were purchased and assembled at Raufoss in Norway. (In Norway the L3314 is commonly known as "Felt", meaning "field" from its Norwegian military designation; ''Vogn, felt, 1/2 tonn, 4x4, Volvo, modell L3314N'')
The Royal Netherlands Army bought a special version able to ford extra deep water (compared to the standard 0.5 metre fording limit).
Saudi Arabia took deliveries of some 200 ''L3314N Oken'', which was an adapted version of the Norwegian version L3314N.
Both versions are employed by civilians for rescue services and private use. Many L3314s have been sold as military surplus and are used by off-road enthusiasts.
The Laplander used Constant-velocity joints in its front axle, of the type invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa.
The L3314 and the L3315 were manufactured at Volvo's Lundby-plant in Goteborg.
