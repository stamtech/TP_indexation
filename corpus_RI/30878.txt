The Luna 21 spacecraft landed on the Moon and deployed the second Soviet lunar rover (Lunokhod 2) in January, 1973.   The primary objectives of the mission were to collect images of the lunar surface, examine ambient light levels to determine the feasibility of astronomical observations from the Moon, perform laser ranging experiments from Earth, observe solar X-rays, measure local magnetic fields, and study the soil mechanics of the lunar surface material.
The rover stood 135&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft 5 in) high and had a mass of 840&nbsp;kg (1,850&nbsp;lb). It was about 170&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;ft 7 in) long and 160&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;ft 3 in) wide and had 8 wheels each with an independent suspension, electric motor and brake. The rover had two speeds, ~1&nbsp;km/h and ~2&nbsp;km/h (0.6&nbsp;mph and 1.2&nbsp;mph). Lunokhod 2 was equipped with three television cameras, one mounted high on the rover for navigation, which could return high resolution images at different frame rates&mdash;3.2, 5.7, 10.9 or 21.1 seconds per frame. These images were used by a five-man team of controllers on Earth who sent driving commands to the rover in real time. Power was supplied by a solar panel on the inside of a round hinged lid which covered the instrument bay, which would charge the batteries when opened. A polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit was used to keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights. There were four panoramic cameras mounted on the rover. Scientific instruments included a soil mechanics tester, solar X-ray experiment, an astrophotometer to measure visible and ultraviolet light levels, a magnetometer deployed in front of the rover on the end of a 2.5 m (8&nbsp;ft 2 in) boom, a radiometer, a photodetector (Rubin-1) for laser detection experiments, and a French-supplied laser corner reflector. The lander carried a bas relief of Lenin and the Soviet coat of arms. The lander and rover together massed 1814&nbsp;kg.
The SL-12/D-1-e launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by translunar injection. On January 12, 1973 Luna 21 was braked into a 90 by 100&nbsp;km (56 by 62 mile) lunar orbit. On January 13 and January 14, the perilune was lowered to 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) altitude. 
On January 15 after 40 orbits, the braking rocket was fired at 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) altitude, and the craft went into free fall. At an altitude of 750 m (2,460&nbsp;ft) the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22&nbsp;m (72&nbsp;ft) was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) above the surface, where the engine was switched off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85 degrees N, 30.45 degrees E.
After landing, the Lunokhod 2 took TV images of the surrounding area, then rolled down a ramp to the surface at 01:14 UT on January 16 and took pictures of the Luna 21 lander and landing site, driving for 30 metres. After a period of charging up its batteries, it took more pictures of the site and the lander, and then set off to explore the moon.
The rover would run during the lunar day, stopping occasionally to recharge its batteries with the solar panels. At night the rover hibernated until the next sunrise, heated by the radioactive source. 
On June 4, 1973 it was announced that the program was completed, leading to speculation that the vehicle probably failed in mid-May or could not be revived after the lunar night of May-June. 
More recently, Alexander Basilevsky related an account where on May 9, 1973, the rover's open lid touched a crater wall and became covered with dust. When the lid was closed for the lunar night, this dust (a very good insulator) was dumped on to the radiators. The following lunar day, controllers saw the internal temperature of the Lunokhod climb as it was unable to cool itself, eventually rendering the rover inoperable.
Lunokhod 2 operated for about 4 months, covered 37&nbsp;km (23 miles) of terrain, including hilly upland areas and rilles, and sent back 86 panoramic images and over 80,000 TV pictures. The 37&nbsp;km journey remains the longest any robotic rover has ever been driven on another celestial body. Many mechanical tests of the surface, laser ranging measurements, and other experiments were completed during this time.
Lunokhod 2 continues to be detected by lunar laser ranging experiments and its position is known to sub-meter accuracy.  On March 17, 2010 Phil Stooke, a professor at the University of Western Ontario announced that he had located Lunokhod 2's final resting place in photographs made by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.
Ownership of Lunokhod 2 and the Luna 21 lander was sold by the Lavochkin Association for $68,500 in December 1993 at a Sotheby's auction in New York. (The catalog incorrectly lists lot 68A as Luna 17/Lunokhod 1).
The buyer was computer gaming entrepreneur and astronaut's son Richard Garriott (also known as Lord British), who stated in a 2001 interview with Computer Games Magazine's Cindy Yans  that:
