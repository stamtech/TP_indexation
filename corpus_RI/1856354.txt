From Jan-March 2004 Binion's Horseshoe was closed. It was purchased by Harrah's Entertainment who retained the brand names World Series of Poker and Horseshoe. They sold the physical property on March 11, 2004 to MTR Gaming Group, which operated the hotel.  Harrah's continued to operate the casino under a temporary contract until March 11, 2005. MTR renamed the property ''Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel''.  On March 7, 2008 MTR sold the hotel-casino to TLC Casino Enterprises, Inc.
In July 2005 Binion's hosted the World Series of Poker (WSOP) main event for the last time. The famous poker tournament, which originated at the property, had simply outgrown the space at Binion's; additionally, Harrah's now owned the tournament and wanted to host it at one of its properties. In 2005, all events, except the final three tables of the main event, were played at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.  The casino still retains a large poker area and features displays on the Poker Hall of Fame as well as previous WSOP Champions.
The $1 million casino floor display, once a free tourist photo attraction, was returned the week of August 11, 2008.  The original had featured $10,000 bills, common in the 1950s when it had been assembled.  The new display contains 2,700 $100 bills, 34,400 $20 bills and 42,000 $1 bills.
When TLC Casino Enterprises, finalized the purchase of Binion's on March 11, 2008 they announced that they intended to expand the hotel with a new tower. On November 27, 2009, Inc. TLC announced the closure of the Binion's hotel and coffee shop effective December 14 due to the Late-2000s recession, though the profitable casino will remain open. TLC will continue to operate the hotel at the Four Queens casino across the street which has almost twice as many rooms. Currently, Binions advertises the hotel as closed for renovations.
In 2005, the outside of the hotel (along with its famous former "Horseshoe" logo) is featured prominently in the video Snoop Dogg's 2005 single, "Signs" featuring Justin Timberlake.
The hotel was seen in the 2007 film ''Lucky You''. Its history was also mentioned in "Chum Goes AWOL", a second season episode of the History Channel reality television series ''Pawn Stars'', which aired in 2010.
