The first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped.  He then disappears underground through a metal trap door.  While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it.
After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof.  When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble.  The entire city around them has been destroyed.  Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door.  
With the cell phone (apparently the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened.  Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble as the vignette ends.
In an online interview, executive producer Carol Barbee announced that there would be a "digital connection" to Jericho through an online companion at Jericho's official site with mini-episodes featured on CBS.com's Innertube featuring the "other survivors" of the nuclear attacks outside of ''Jericho's'' primary setting of Jericho, Kansas.  According to Barbee, the story was to be unique to the site, but as the season of Jericho continued, it would have dovetailed into the episodes themselves.
