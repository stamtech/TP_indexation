On March 13, 1834,, the town was renamed Warren in honor of General Joseph Warren, who died at the Battle of Bunker Hill during the Revolutionary War. The need to rename the town came about upon the discovery of another town in Massachusetts sharing the name Western..
According to the document  Western was renamed Warren due to "countless mistakes in the transmission of the mails" (p.&nbsp;9). On January 13, 1834 a town meeting was held to discuss a name change.
