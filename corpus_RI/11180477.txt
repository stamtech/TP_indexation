We have had two previous discussions about this and the results were ''' ''' and ''' ''' so it seems fair to take another look.

Obama's family is now stated to include people as diverse as Queen Elizabeth II and Elvis Presley and so it's time to call a halt before we all end up in there.  Obama's immediate family can be covered in their own articles if they are notable or in a brief mention in Obama's article, if they are not.
