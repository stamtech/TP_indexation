After the airing of his second hour special, ''Chewed Up''. Louis C.K. launched his ''Hilarious'' tour in the fall of 2008, where he continued his trend of ditching all the material of his previous effort and began performing with a brand new hour. The themes and subjects include C.K.'s life now living post-divorce, kids, and numerous accounts of social criticism  such as the infamous, "Everything's Amazing & Nobody's Happy" routine (featured on the album as, ''Cell Phones and Flying'') which he had done in conversation on the October 1, 2008 episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien resulting in a viral frenzy after being posted to YouTube and other media outlets; it has been seen over 2 million times. In reference to the appearance and internet attention a writer for ''Vanity Fair'' praised his honesty saying:
While on his tour, he also landed a deal to shoot a pilot for FX; featuring a loosely autobiographical depiction of his life as a single dad living as a comedian in New York City. Soon after, the show was then placed for an order of 13 episodes requiring a new hour of material aside from the hour written for the ''Hilarious'' tour. Louis stated on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast that his 4th hour went into the show but was performed with the ''Hilarious'' material on the same tour.
In his special "Hilarious" Louis C.K. incorrectly referenced Wilbur Wright as "Wendell Wright" in the track: "Cell Phones and Flying"
At the end of the tour he filmed the material as his third one-hour special at The Pabst Theater in Milwaukee during April 2009, with Louis himself serving as director and editor. It was filmed as a concert special expected to be screened in movie theaters, which was done limitedly in select cities such as; Austin, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C..
