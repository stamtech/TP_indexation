In 2001, Yahoo! introduced an email filter which automatically replaced Javascript-related strings with alternate versions, to prevent the possibility of JavaScript viruses in HTML email. The filter would hyphenate the terms "Javascript", "Jscript", "Vbscript" and "Livescript", and replaced "eval", "mocha" and "expression" with the similar but not quite synonymous terms "review", "espresso" and "statement". Assumptions were involved in the writing of the filters: no attempts were made to limit these string replacements to script sections and attributes, or to respect word boundaries, in case this would leave some loophole open.
One unintended effect of this was that the word ''medieval'' became ''medireview'', in the body of Yahoo! email messages.  Not all email recipients recognised this as an error or may have even thought it was intentional.  there are still web pages seen which use ''medireview'' instead of ''medieval''.  Among other effects were the replacement of ''evaluation'' with ''reviewuation'', ''expressionist'' with ''statementist'', ''prevalent'' with ''prreviewent'' and the replacement of the French word ''cheval'' (horse) with ''chreview'', rendering them into near-gibberish.
