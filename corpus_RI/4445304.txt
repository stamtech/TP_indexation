The '''2004 USC Trojans football team''' represented the University of Southern California in the 2004-2005 NCAA Division I-A college football season. Although now vacated for breaking NCAA rules, the team won the 2004 BCS National Championship by winning the 2005 Orange Bowl, that year's BCS National Championship Game. The team also won the AP title for the second year in a row.
Because of the controversy that ended the 2003 NCAA Division I-A football season with a split national title between LSU and USC, the motto for the Trojans' 2004 season became "Leave No Doubt."  Ironically, the changes made to the BCS due to the 2003 season did not resolve issues with multiple undefeated teams, as Auburn and Utah finished undefeated, yet they did not get to play USC or any other team for the title.
On June 10, 2010, USC was forced to vacate its two final wins from the 2004 season (December 2004 against UCLA and the BCS championship game), as well as all wins from the 2005 season, following an NCAA investigation into possible violations by the Trojans' football and men's basketball programs. Since the vacated games included the Trojans' Orange Bowl win, the Trojans were later stripped of the 2004 BCS title in June 2011. However, the Associated Press still recognizes USC as 2004 AP title winner.. ESPN, 2010-06-11.
The Trojans finished the season with an 13-0 record, 8-0 in the Pac-10.. This record was retroactively changed in 2010 to a 11-0 record, 7-0 in the Pac-10 due to NCAA sanctions forcing USC to vacate two wins from the 2004 season.Mark Saxon, , ''ESPN'', June 10, 2010.

Russo, , Associated Press, August 29, 2004.  The game marked the emergence of running back Reggie Bush, who often lined up at wide receiver, catching five passes for 127 yards and scored three touchdowns in a tight game.  Although Virginia Tech was not ranked going into the game, they ended the season ranked 9th, going 10-3 (7-1 in the ACC), becoming ACC Champions in their first year in the conference and were invited to the 2005 Nokia Sugar Bowl., San Diego Hokies Alumni Chapter, ''Accessed June 13, 2007''.

USC had what would be its closest game of the season against the unheralded Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium in their Pacific-10 Conference opener.Doug Alden, , Associated Press, September 25, 2004.  Both USC and Stanford had just previously beat BYU in convincing fashion, however Stanford had the added benefit of a bye week to rest and reorganize between games., Yahoo! Sports, September 25, 2004.  By halftime, USC found itself down 11 points after the Cardinal caught them by surprise with an 82-yard run final play while trying to run out the clock to end the half.

There was some controversy in the final team selections as the Auburn Tigers had also finished the regular season undefeated and won their bowl game, the Sugar Bowl, against the same Virginia Tech team USC defeated in the season opener; Auburn began the season ranked outside the top 15 and perhaps because of this they were unable to secure a spot in the national championship game, although they did tie Oklahoma at #2 in the AP poll at one point late in the season.

In June 2010, the NCAA imposed sanctions on USC as a result of an investigation into the football program.  One of the major focuses was improper gifts given to Reggie Bush.
The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from sports agents Lloyd Lake and Michael Michaels from at least December 2004 in violation of NCAA rules of amateurism.  As a result, USC was placed on four years' probation and forced to vacate its last two wins of the 2004 season as well as all of its wins in the 2005 season.  It was also banned from bowl games in 2010 and 2011 and lose 30 scholarships over three years.  Running backs coach Todd McNair was banned from off-campus recruiting for one year after the NCAA determined he'd known about Bush's dealings with the agents.  The NCAA also forced USC to permanently disassociate itself from Bush.
The vacated games included the Trojans' Orange Bowl win. On June 6, 2011, the BCS officially vacated USC's 2004 National Championship. The AP released a statement saying that USC will keep its 2004 AP title. The university filed an appeal of the sanctions which was later denied by the NCAA.
