Seed grew up in Corvallis, Montana, where he attended Corvallis High School.  He was a member of the 1987 Montana All-State basketball team. Huck Seed was an electrical engineering student at California Institute of Technology and a member of Fleming House. He took a leave of absence in 1989, started playing poker, and never returned to college. Seed was a star player on Caltech's basketball team and is featured in the 2006 documentary ''Quantum Hoops''.
Seed won the 1996 World Series of Poker main event, his second bracelet, and the $1,000,000 first prize. He made the final table of the 1999 WSOP event, but was eliminated in sixth place by eventual champion Noel Furlong. In the 2007 Main Event, Seed finished 73rd out of 6358 players.
Seed won the 2009 NBC Heads-Up Poker Championship. In doing so, he took the top prize of $500,000 and improved his overall record in the event to 18-4, an all-time best for win total. In addition, Huck Seed became the only player to cash in every NBC Heads-Up tournament. This record was broken in the 2010 tournament with his first round loss to eventual runner-up Erik Seidel
In 2010,  Seed won the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions freeroll for $500,000.
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $5,825,000. He has four WSOP bracelets and 39 total cashes at the WSOP, accounting for $2,831,985 of his live tournament winnings.
Seed has been involved in many "prop bets". He once made a $10,000 proposition bet with Phil Hellmuth and Konstantin Othmer that he could float in the ocean for 24 hours without touching the bottom. By bet rules, he was not allowed to bet more than an additional $15,000, and could settle the bet without attempting the feat for $5000, which is what eventually happened. This bet has been incorrectly reported; Huck discusses it in a podcast.
Seed once took a six figure bet that he could break 100 on a desert golf course four times in a day using just a five iron, sand wedge and putter. He has also bet that he would be able to go an entire year without shaving.
