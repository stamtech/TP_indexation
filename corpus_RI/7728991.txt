The largest solar power installation in the world is the 354 MW solar thermal SEGS plant, completed in 1991. The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (392 MW), located   southwest of Las Vegas, is the world's largest solar thermal power project currently under construction.
California leads the nation in the total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. In 2008, the state decided that it was not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and enacted a Feed-in Tariff.

The Imperial Valley Solar Project (formerly SES Solar Two) is  a proposed 709 MW solar thermal power station to be located in Imperial County, California.  It will be of stirling engine design and the company involved is Tessera Solar.
Solel has signed a contract with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to build the world's largest solar plant in the Mojave Desert. When fully operational in 2011, the proposed Mojave Solar Park will have an installed capacity of 553&nbsp;megawatts of solar power, calculated to power 400,000&nbsp;homes, to PG&E   s customers in northern and central California. The plant will cover up to  of land. ''Ynetnews'', July 26, 2007. Retrieved December 18, 2008., Tom Parry, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, August 15, 2007.
The Genesis Solar Energy Project is a proposed 250 MW solar thermal power station to be located in Riverside County, California.  It will be of parabolic trough design, and the company involved is NextEra Energy Resources.
The goal is to install 3,000 MW by 2016. California has more photovoltaics installed than any other state, and 69% of the total in 2007. For the first time in 2008 the installed photovoltaics exceeded the states 354&nbsp;MW of solar thermal.

California increased the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 33% by 2020 in 2008. Each utility is also required to reach 20% by 2010. In 2006, California produced (and/or imported) about 295,000 gigawatt-hours (GW  h) of electricity, which is expected to decrease by 10% over the ten year period beginning in 2009, due to efficiency increases. The principle renewable sources in 2006 were hydroelectricity, 48,431&nbsp;GW  h, geothermal, 13,226, organic waste, 5,682, wind power, 4,420, and solar power, 616. The capacity factor of solar is approximately 20%, so 30,000 GWh (roughly 33% of total generation, subtracting other sources) would require approximately 17,000&nbsp;MWp of solar power. Wind, at a capacity factor of 35%, would require 9,800&nbsp;MWp of wind farms to produce the same total. At the end of 2008, California had 792&nbsp;MWp of solar and 2,517&nbsp;MWp of wind farms. California officials are now attempting to import the form of feed-in tariffs, a tool similar to what Europe has been using, to encourage the solar power industry. Proposals were raised aiming to create a small-scale solar market in California that brings the benefits of the German market, such as distributed generation, which avoids the need for transmission because power is generated close to where it's used, and avoid the drawbacks such as excessively high payments that could become a burden on utility customers.
According to a recent report by the California Public Utilities Commission, California failed to meet the 20% threshold in 2010. Pacific Gas & Electric Co and Southern California Edison were the closest to meeting the goal. PG&E generated 17.7% of the electricity it sold in 2010 from renewable sources while SCE was the closest to hitting the RPS goal by producing 19.4% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2010. San Diego Gas & Electric, on the other hand, generated only 11.9% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2010.
The California Solar Initiative is a 2006 initiative to install 3,000&nbsp;MW of additional solar power by 2016. Included in it is the million solar roof initiative.
California has a favorable net metering law, being one of five states to receive an A, while five states received an F, in an evaluation of the 38&nbsp;states plus Washington D.C. which have net metering.
According to the CPUC, homeowners, businesses, and local governments installed 158&nbsp;MW of solar photovoltaics (PV) in 2008, doubling the 78&nbsp;MW installed in 2007, giving California a cumulative total of 441&nbsp;MW of distributed solar PV systems, the highest in the country.
Many of the homes, schools and businesses which have installed solar panels can be monitored online on the internet.
Using a 20-year property assessment known as PACE Financing, Berkeley plans to be the first city in the country to allow thousands of residents to obtain solar power without any initial payment. In the plan, property owners pay as much in increased property taxes as they save in energy costs, allowing them to install the panels for free at no cost to the city. Thirty eight projects are being installed for the pilot stage of the program.
