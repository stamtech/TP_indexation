After the Seoul National Hall was destroyed by fire in 1972, the City Council of Seoul commissioned the construction of a venue to continue the cultural heritage of that structure. Built in 1978, commissioned by the City of Seoul, Sejong Center was largely unsupported financially for 20 years, being under the control of the Special City of Seoul. In 1999, the center was placed under control of a foundation governed by civilians whose passion for the arts fueled its massive newfound success.
The center's design was based on a fusion of Korean national symbols and the western architectural designs. The name "Sejong" is from the 4th ruling King of the Joseon Dynasty, Sejong the Great.
The Sejong Center is made up of many different halls, centers and theaters.
The "Big" Theater as it is called in Korean, is a technologically  advanced theater.
Called The "Small" Theater in Korean, is constructed in an interesting style over 2 floors, and can seat 442 people, the stage can allow for 100 people on performance.
The Gwang Hwa Rang is situated underneath the Sejong-ro crossroads, it opened on February 17, 2005 with complete free access to pedestrians and art-discerning Seoulites. It includes a window-gallery that enable by-passers on ground level to peek inside.
The Convention Center and Hall is usually used for big events and conferences. With a size of 627 m  , it can house around 400 people. It is available for many different events. It includes 250 translating systems that interprets five different languages simultaneously. The convention hall has a smaller size convention center that is used for similar purposes and is able to accommodate 120 people.
Measuring in 19417m  , Sam Chung Gak is a collaboration of six traditional Korean Housings. Since 2001, it has been used by the Center as a place for traditional heritage experience.
