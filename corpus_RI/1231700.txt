Related to this term are the concepts of crypto-Muslim subgroups, such as crypto-Sunni Muslims and crypto-Shia Muslims.  Each of these Muslim subgroups has suffered persecution at various times under various leaders where it was advantageous to appear as part of the dominant (sometimes also Muslim) group. (e.g. Shia masquerading as Sunni and Sunni masquerading as Shia during periods of unrest between these groups are examples of crypto-Muslim subgroups.) 
Some mention was made of the concept during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Campaign in accusations directed towards President Barack Obama. From 1969 to 1971, Obama attended an Indonesian state primary school. Although Obama has family and ancestors with divergent religious views, he has repeatedly stated he is a Christian and has never been a Muslim.
Syed Abbas ibn    Abd al-Muttalib (Arabic:                                         ) (c. 566     c. 653 CE), a wealthy merchant, was a paternal uncle and companion of Muhammad, only a few years his senior. During the early years of Islam he protected Muhammad while he was in Makkah, but only officially adopted the religion after the Battle of Badr in 624 CE. He concealed his faith, from the Quraishites and was the principal advocate for the Aqaba Pledge. His descendants founded the Abbassid caliphate in 750 CE.
