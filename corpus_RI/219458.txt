The '''Volvo PV''' is a series of two door, four passenger car models     the PV444 and the PV544     made by Volvo from 1947 to 1965.
During World War II's early stages, Volvo decided that a new smaller car delivering good fuel economy would assure the company's future. A raw materials shortage during the war drove home the point that an automobile should be smaller, and also complicated Volvo's ability to mass-produce the product. In 1944, when the car was finally introduced to a car-hungry public, response was very positive and orders poured in from the Swedish population. It was another three years though, in 1947, before the production was made available.
The PV444 was Volvo's first uni-body car. It was also the first Volvo in almost 20 years to come with a 4-cylinder engine. The first PV444s were powered by a 40&nbsp;hp 1.4&nbsp;L inline-4 engine designated the '''B4B''', with three main bearings, overhead valves, and a single downdraft carburettor. Late in 1955, an uprated version called the '''B14A''' was given twin side-draught 11/2&nbsp;in SU carburettors.
By the 1957 model year, engine displacement was increased to 1.6&nbsp;L and both single downdraft- '''B16A''' and twin side-draught-carburetted '''B16B''' versions were offered. Fuel economy was quite above average and performance particularly with the twin carburettor configuration was brisk. The combination of performance and durability won over many two-seat sports car drivers, allowing them a pleasurable drive in the entire family's company if desired.
In 1958, the '''PV544''' was phased in. Subtle differences with the PV444 included the introduction of a curved one-piece windshield to replace the two panes of flat glass, larger taillights, and a ribbon-type speedometer. The 444's 3-speed manual transmission was also supplanted by a 4-speed unit in the 544.
The next significant change occurred in 1962, when the B16 was replaced by Volvo's new '''B18 engine''', initially developed for the P1800 sports car introduced the previous year. This 1.8&nbsp;L engine had five main bearings. Again single and twin carburettor versions were offered, designated B18A and B18D, respectively. The U.S. market saw very few B18A cars since the United States' public prioritised performance over fuel economy. Also in 1962, Volvo changed from 6- to 12-volt electrical systems. In 1963 Volvo began producing the 544 at their new Canadian Dartmouth/Halifax plant, the first Volvo plant to be located outside of Sweden.
The PV544 was also made as an estate (wagon) version, the '''Duett''', initially designated the '''P445''' and later the '''P210'''.
The 544 received incremental mechanical revisions and trim changes until its final production year of 1965. Exactly 440,000 units were built during the 18-year run. The car had so endeared itself to its owners that Volvo ran self-deprecating advertisements in late 1965 and early 1966 imploring PV owners not to be angry with the company.
The Duett's utility allowed Volvo to continue the wagon's production through the 1969 model year. These were then replaced in some markets by a high-roof version of the Volvo 145, called the '''Express'''.
