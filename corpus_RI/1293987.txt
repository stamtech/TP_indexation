Nash was born in Sydney and was educated at Mitchell College in Bathurst, New South Wales, where she graduated in arts. Between 1999 and 2004 she worked as staff member for National Party federal ministers, Mark Vaile, Larry Anthony, and De-Anne Kelly.
In 2008, she was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Water Resources and Conservation on the Opposition frontbench, but was asked to resign by Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull when she expressed her support for a motion by the Australian Greens to block the introduction of up-front tax breaks for carbon sinks. She did so, and subsequently crossed the floor with four other National senators to vote for the motion.
After the 2010 election she returned to the Opposition frontbench when appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Education by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott in September 2010.
Nash is married to David Nash, a farmer, and has two children. They live in the Young district in the south-west region of southern New South Wales.
