Gallagher attended the Newcastle School of Art and Design, inspired by the work of W. Eugene Smith, Don McCullin, Eamonn McCabe, Walter Loos and Richard Avedon's portrait work, particularly "In the American West".
His commercial clients include Reebok, Canon, Mazda, Merrill Lynch and Vivendi Universal and he has also photographed advertising campaigns for Pepsi and Gatorade. 
Robert Gallagher has portraited world leaders, politicians and celebrities such as HRH Prince Charles, Nancy Pelosi, Sidney Poitier, Tony Bennett, Clint Eastwood, Penelope Cruz, Jamie Cullum and Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner from the Twilight films.
He has also covered significant subjects such as the hurricane Katrina survivors and the 9/11 rescue workers. In December 2001, just two months after September 11, his first solo exhibition 'Ground Hero- Portraits of September 11' was profiled live by ABC News, during the charity opening night.
Gallagher's portraiture is included in the archives of The National Portrait Gallery in London
