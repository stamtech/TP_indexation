This article is just a re-hash of the information on http://labs.google.com/ and http://www.google.com/options/index.html It has no encyclopedic content, just a list of services from a busniess, which will change over time.
Look, this article is just fancruft plain and simple. It is overly large and the topic of Google on Wikipedia is overly divided and longwinded. Take a look at the Yahoo article, and notice that Yahoo is a) twice as large as google b) older than google c) has a lot more services than Google. If there weren't so many zealots around here worshipping Google we wouldn't have this problem. And this is where groupthink kicks in; what do you do when everyone in the vote is biased towards worshipping the same thing? How about some objectivity around here. It's obvious the article is just crap and possibly violating Google's rights by putting '''30''' of their corporate logos on a single page. --  16:59, Mar 14, 2005 (UTC)
