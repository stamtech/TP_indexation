Not a high priority, since the article still needs some work to become a GAC, but I'll probably try to make this into a GAC somewhat soon. Wisconsin has no GA-class or higher road articles yet, and this one might as well be first. --        02:00, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

Could use a map, why not. No shields on the map, please.        00:01, 6 January 2009 (UTC)
I would like to request the following maps as part of the New Jersey GA drive:

This is a nice, short road. I believe that a map would really help the article. I am the GA reviewer, and the lack of a map is the only thing holding it back. I will promote the article, but I hope that a map can be added soon. Thanks,   ( ) 05:12, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
This article needs a map.  It has been nominated for a good article and is waiting for a map.   ( ) 17:31, 15 October 2008 (UTC)
Uh, per the A-class review for New York State Route 343, we need a map that details the CT side as well and uses the right colors. Is there any chance this could be fixed soon?    12:41, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

Just B-class articles that could use a map. I'd like it if they were without shields, if possible.
Hope this isn't too much, I tried to go by the route's length when I decided to request it or not. Thanks - '''''  '''''     18:50, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
I know this is borderline overload, but the map for Utah State Route 201 is incorrect; the east end extends to US-89. '''''  '''''     23:41, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
First off, I know this is C-class, but I feel the length permits me to list this under B-class (there is no technical place to put this anyway, C-class isn't mentioned in the headers). Anyway, I'm planning to get this to GA soon, and I'd like a map. Something a la   would be great. No shields, that same zoom, and even that positioning would work for the route (though the latter isn't that necessary, just a suggestion). This route existed until 2007 though, that's the tricky part. I'm not familiar with GIS data but from what I know, if someone could obtain old GIS data, this could work (at least I hope so). Regards,        04:18, 20 July 2008 (UTC)
This was expanded to B-class recently. It could sure use a map, something like   (without shields). I originally filed this request at 25or6to4's talk page (I was commenting there on something else) but he never got around to it. Thanks -        21:02, 26 July 2008 (UTC)
Can I get a map of Adams Avenue Parkway? It is a short 1 mile toll road near Ogden, Utah connecting U.S. 89 to I-84. --  (            ) 00:24, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
This is a GA class article without a map. I hope to take this article to FA someday, once finished with my current projects. Thanks in advance.   ( ) 05:28, 5 August 2008 (UTC)
I'm surprised there's no map in the infobox...and that I haven't noticed it until now.  I'd appreciate if someone could make this if they have the time.  A map similar in style to the one at U.S. Route 50 in Nevada would be preferred.  Thanks in advance.  --  ( ) 21:46, 19 June 2008 (UTC)
Any chance someone could create maps for the U.S. Routes in Nevada?  That is, of course, if they have the time.  The routes:
I'd like all maps in the same style, as discussed under the "Interstate 15 in Nevada" section above.  All these routes are plotted on previous map images, so I imagine they shouldn't be too hard to create.  None of these are really a priority, but they'll need maps eventually.  Thanks in advance!  --  ( ) 21:49, 18 July 2008 (UTC)
I-115 aritce has been asking for a map. Can somebody provide a map?--      00:34, 18 July 2008 (UTC)
The article already has a map in the infobox, but I would like to request an additional map to be used in the history section.  Something similar to the map  would be great.  I am going to use it to help the reader visualize where specific cross streets are when I mention them in the history section.  The map should be taller then it is wide since it is a north-south highway and it will be placed along the right side of the text.  Thanks!  --'''   ''' 21:14, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
The Legacy Parkway, a freeway under construction, could use a map. This will be a future state route, the route number has to be approved by the State Legislature first. Not sure how mapping under construction routes goes, if the path is dashed or not, but in any event I'd like it without shields. If you need a source for the routing of the Parkway it is  (download the Wasatch Front inset pdf). Thanks -   ( ) 02:43, 22 April 2008 (UTC)
NY 28's FAC has a request to add the shield to the map, so if I could get that done soon, it'd be great. Thanks,       21:12, 1 June 2008 (UTC)
A few improvements have been made to SR 43.  It is a hidden designation for US 45E through West Tennessee for the most part with signed sections around Martin, TN and South Fulton.  Low priority though...Thanks again   ( ) 22:54, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
I've just had a collection of maps that were tagged for deletion, claiming they can be replaced, but I've had my doubts, which has lead to some edit wars I'd rather avoid. In case I'm wrong about this, I'd like to request some replacemnts for the following non-free maps: 
These maps are useful for explaining how the selected roads were supposed to have been built. But as they stand now, they're not free. I'd like to see some that ''don't'' violate any copyright laws by April 27, 2008 if that's possible. If not, perahps somebody here can photocopy the images, or save them in some other way, and use them as references for replacements. --  ( ) 22:20, 22 April 2008 (UTC)
A C-class article (yes, ''C''-class) that I would like to see up to B. The route is quite short, less than a half-mile long. I'm not too terribly picky about this but I'd like it without shields if possible, though it doesn't matter much -        02:06, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
Would it be possible to create a map for Buffalo's Roadway network like Erie, PA's?

I was looking through B-class articles that could ''especially'' use a map and came up with SR-37, SR-48, SR-52 and SR-111. Hope this isn't too much at once. Thanks in advance,        16:59, 18 October 2008 (UTC)

This article is severely in need of a map; it will most likely lose Good Article status if somebody reviews it again and it doesn't have a map like it did the first time around. So somebody make one that includes I-10, I-17, US 60 (not the Grand Ave portion), Loop 101, Loop 202, Loop 303, AZ 51, and AZ 143. Thanks in advance.
Thank you very much, it looks great!   ( ) 02:01, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
My first map request. It'd be nice to get rid of the red link there. Granted, the article needs more than just a map, but hey... one hurdle at a time. ----   ( ) 14:42, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
