Skovde is situated some 150&nbsp;km northeast of Gothenburg, between Sweden's two largest lakes, Vanern and Vattern.  It sits on the eastern slope of a low mountain ridge Billingen (299 m), which cuts through the plain between the lakes.  The western main railway (''Vastra Stambanan'') was located through Skovde in the 1890s, which dramatically gave the town an industrial and population boost.
Skovde traces its history back to the medieval age. On its city arms is the image of Saint Helena who allegedly was a pious woman from Skovde. She was born about 1101, and was canonized in 1165 by Pope Alexander III and Archbishop Stefan of Sweden.
Of the medieval houses nothing remains, as a fire in 1759 burnt down the entire city except for some houses called Helensgarden. After the fire, the city was rebuilt according to the grid pattern. The city still only had a small population until the railroad between Stockholm and Gothenburg was laid through the city and leading to an industrial and population boost.
