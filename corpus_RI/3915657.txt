Hello Doug,
I have a few questions:
1. What is your wikipedia user name?  I'd like to take a look at your edits, so I can get to know you as an editor.
2. Do you have a webpage or blog so I can get to know you better?  
Since you've already found my website and wikipedia user page you already have access to my information.
I'm also curious where and how you came to your opinions.  Let me know, because I am always interested in learning more about other's thoughts.
Respectfully,
Cliff
