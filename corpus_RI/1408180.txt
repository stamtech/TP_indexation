The '''Sectera Secure Module''' is a device that can provide encryption of both voice and data. It is used in the Sectera Wireline Terminal for use with standard PSTN devices and has been incorporated into a slim module to use with a Motorola GSM cell phone.  The module is placed between the battery and the body of the phone. The phone may be used as a regular GSM phone when the security module is not activated by the PIN.
Another member of the Sectera family, '''Sectera Edge''', is a smart phone that supports both classified and unclassified voice and data communication, including access to the SIPRNET. The Sectera Edge costs approximately $3,000.
The Sectera Edge was developed by General Dynamics competing against a product by L-3 under an $18 million contract from the National Security Agency. Available since mid-2008, it is already used by tens of thousands of employees in the intelligence community and the Defense, Homeland Security, and State Departments among others. 
The Sectera Edge has been reported to be the smartphone used by President Barack Obama, replacing his BlackBerry,  which has earned it the nickname "'''BarackBerry'''".
The '''Sectera Wireline Terminal''' interfaces between a standard telephone and the local exchange to the PSTN. It is connected by standard RJ11 jack.  The device cannot be used to communicate without a connected telephone.
