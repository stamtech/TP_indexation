The '''Dubai World Championship''' is a golf tournament on the European Tour that was held for the first time from 19&ndash;22 November 2009 on the Earth course at the Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The event is the climax of the new European Tour Race to Dubai, which replaces the Order of Merit from 2009, and will be contested by the leading 60 money winners following the Hong Kong Open.  The tournament itself functions as the replacement of the Volvo Masters, which was a similar event for the leading 60 money winners on the Order of Merit.  As a side, Valderrama Golf Club which hosted the Volvo Masters now hosts the Andalucia Valderrama Masters which is part of the European Tour.  
Originally the tournament was to have a record prize fund of $10,000,000, of which the winner's share would be $1,666,660, however in September 2009 it was announced that there would be a 25% reduction in both the overall prize fund and the winners cheque.
