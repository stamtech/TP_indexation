According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.2 square miles (18.7&nbsp;km  ).The area is hilly in some areas but has good grass and trees in most places because much of Miller Place was farm land before the population of Long Island grew.
Miller Place contains a small pond, a beach, and a small park that contains a baseball field.  There are also many historical buildings in Miller Place. However, nearly all lands are heavily developed by either suburban housing communities or commercial locations.
The hamlet borders the towns of Sound Beach, Mount Sinai, Rocky Point, Middle Island and Coram.
Miller Place is a town that has been inhabited during five centuries.  The region has gone through, and has been affected by, events including the French and Indian War and American Revolution.  Throughout most of its history, Miller Place has been an agricultural based society.  However, similarly to the changes in much of Long Island, the hamlet has transformed into a densely populated suburban area in recent decades.
While the original settler of Miller Place is unknown, the settling of the region is largely accredited to the original Miller family.  In 1679, a man named John Thomas is known to have sold a local  plot to Andrew Miller, a cooper from either England or Scotland.  Miller's family expanded well into the 18th century and continually developed houses near the northern part of town.
The Millers were in time joined by members of such families as the Helmes, Robinsons, Burnetts, Hawkins, Woodhulls, and Thomases of Imperial
The first public school in the town was established in 1813.  By 1818, 47 students attended classes.  The original building was destroyed by a stove-fire in 1835, so a new one-room building was erected near the Ebenezer Miller house in 1837.  The district moved to the Academy in 1897, a building that still stands as a small library along present-day North Country Road.  In 1918 the old schoolhouse was torn down and in 1937 a new building was constructed across from the Miller Place Pond.  In 1852, it was recorded that fifty children were being taught.  In 1932, records show only twenty-one students enrolled at the school.
The hamlet became home to a station of the Long Island Railroad in 1895.  This location was near the present day intersection of Sylvan and Echo Avenues. It transported people to stops at Port Jefferson, Wading River, and numerous other towns.  Upon the station burning down in a 1902 fire, a new one was built the next year.  However, this building was destroyed in 1930 by another fire and the eastern railroad lines were soon abandoned.
In the later 19th century, Miller Place became a popular summer resort location.  A barn-like building known as the Harbor House was established and run by a Miss Clara Potter and quickly became a haven for many young girls.  However the building was destroyed in a 1962 fire.
Many historical residencies still remain, mostly along what is now North Country Road.  Also, many roads in the present town have been named after historical families.   A number of historic building were included in the Miller Place Historic District, listed on  the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  Separately listed is the Samuel Hopkins House.
