Originally unveiled in 2002 at the Singapore Police Force's annual workplan seminar, the '''Enhanced Patrol Vehicle Project''' was presented to highlight the need for police off-road capability. The Volvo V70 AWD XC, Mitsubishi Space Wagon and Mitsubishi Chariot underwent evaluation in various Neighbourhood Police Centres. They also provide bigger storage for additional equipment like undercarriage mirrors. All NPCs were to have at least three of such vehicles eventually, but as of 2006, only 6 have been purchased in total (3 Volvo V70 XCs, 3 Mitsubishi Space Wagons/Chariots).
The project underwent several evaluations and in 2004, was re-introduced to the public as the new Enhanced '''Fast Response Vehicle (FRV)'''. This time, consisting instead of modified *Toyota Hilux twin-cab pick up trucks, which utilises diesel-power and provide greater ability to endure high usage on the roads over extensive periods of time. Achieving both the original and new requirements of the project, the new vehicles' bigger storage space also allows for easier storage and retrieval of equipment like chemical agent protective suits and bullet-resistant vests. The SPF plans to have two of these vehicles at all NPCs.
The civilian model of the Toyota Hilux vehicles in use in Singapore is the 2-litre turbo pickup truck. The SPF uses the Australian 3-litre turbo 4WD DOHC model instead.
