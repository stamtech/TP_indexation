It is an all aluminium five-cylinder engine with 20 valves and double overhead camshafts. In all but one late version it has a VGT turbocharger of the type VNT (Variable Nozzle Turbine), common rail direct injection and cooled exhaust gas recirculation.
There are three generations of D5 engines. The first generation was introduced in 2001; the second generation was introduced in 2005 and the third was introduced in 2009.
The second generation got a slight reduction in stroke and has a reduced compression ratio, a water-cooled VNT turbocharger with a bigger compressor and an electric servo motor to adjust the vanes, an improved EGR system, a throttle valve, revised intake and exhaust ports and a newer generation of common-rail direct injection with improved injectors.
The third generation got a further reduction in compression ratio, a two stage turbo system (D5244T10), an improved EGR system, revised intake and exhaust ports and a newer generation of common-rail direct injection with higher pressure and piezoelectric injectors.
Volvo has a special version of the D5 for use in the C30, S40, V50 and C70 models that produces 180 hp and 400 Nm of torque (reduced to 350 Nm with automatic transmission). The engine compartments of these cars are smaller so among other things the engine has a different air intake system, different exhaust system, smaller charge air cooler and a smaller radiator.
The D5244T is also offered as a marine engine by Volvo Penta under the name D3. The marinised engine is in large parts identical to D52244T. This includes crankshaft, pistons, camshafts, valves, cylinder block, cylinder head, turbo, injectors and the high pressure pump. The D3 ECU has a modified software, which e.g. gives a modified torque suited for marine applications and has a simplified starting sequence. The hardware differences between D5244T and D3 are: a water cooled inter-cooler, a water cooled exhaust manifold, a heavier monolithic crankwheel, a seawater-pump and a heat exchanger.
The output is  at 3,000 rpm, 130&nbsp;hp, 160&nbsp;hp, 190&nbsp;hp,  at 4,000 rpm and it is coupled to a duoprop I/O system.
