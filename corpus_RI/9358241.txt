The route is mostly operated by long-distance double-decker Volvo B9TL buses, which were introduced in October 2008 to replace the ageing Volvo B12M and Volvo B10M coaches. However, a number of the older coaches along with some Volvo B7TL double-deckers currently supplement the B9 fleet. One of the new buses was involved in a fatal crash in May 2009 after it veered off the road and hit a car.
In the year up to April 2009, the route saw a 15% increase in passenger numbers compared to the previous year.
