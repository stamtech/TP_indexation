The '''Tampa Convention Center''' is a mid-sized convention center located in Downtown Tampa, Florida. Its location is ideal because it has both waterfront views, and views of the skyline.

Harbour Island is right across the eponymous bridge on the other side of the Garrison Channel. It is connected to neighboring Channelside and Harbour Island via the TECO Streetcar. The center encompasses  in total.
It is built on the historical site of Ft. Brooke, the original American settlement on Tampa Bay from which Tampa grew. The Super Bowl XLIII media center was held there.  In recent years the center has become the ''de facto'' location for the bar examination given to lawyers seeking admission to The Florida Bar.
