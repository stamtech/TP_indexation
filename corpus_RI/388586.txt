Opened in 1997, the center includes  of showroom space, 5 exhibit halls, 45 meeting rooms with  of space, a garage with 1,400 parking spaces, and an adjacent Sheraton hotel.
The '''Atlantic City Convention Center''' is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  
The Center was developed in part as an aspect of the city's ongoing attempt to recreate itself as a year-round destination rather than a mere summer resort &mdash; the same thought process that later led to its development as the first major gambling center in the U.S. outside of Nevada in modern times.  
As of 12/31/08, it is the site of North America's (possibly the world's) largest single-rooftop solar photo-voltaic installation. 18,436 panels supply a peak output of 2.72 MW and are expected to generate approximately 25% of the center's total yearly usage. 
The convention center is the home of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association high school wrestling championships and the A-10 Basketball Championship Tournament, as well as the annual Atlantic City Power Boat Show.
Outside the convention center is an interactive bronze statue of Bert Parks holding a crown. When a visitor puts their head inside the crown, sensors activate a recorded playback of his ''"There She Is..."'' line through speakers hidden behind nearby bushes.
The Center is directly connected to a terminal called the Atlantic City Rail Terminal for New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line train line to Philadelphia as well as Atlantic City Express Service service to New York City.
Nearby Boardwalk Hall, previously known as '''Convention Hall''', is home of the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ, dubbed the world's largest pipe organ.
