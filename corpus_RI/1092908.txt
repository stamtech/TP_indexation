The '''Autocar Company''' is a Hagerstown, Indiana specialist manufacturer of cabover vocational trucks, mainly for refuse applications. Started in 1899 in Ardmore, Pennsylvania as a manufacturer of Brass Era automobiles, and from 1907, trucks. The last cars were produced in 1912, but the company continued as a truck maker until 1953 when they were taken over by the White Motor Company.  White was taken over in turn by Volvo Trucks in 1980 with Autocar continuing as a division. In 2001, it was sold to Grand Vehicle Works Holdings, which continues to use the brand name for their line of trucks.
The company was called the ''Pittsburgh Motor Vehicle Company'' when started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1897 but became the Autocar Company in 1899 when it moved to Ardmore, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. One of the company's early cars was the Pittsburgher. By 1907, the company had decided to concentrate on commercial vehicles, and the ''Autocar'' brand is still in use for commercial trucks.
Based on the minutes of company board of directors meetings during 1903-1907 it is known that in 1903 the Board of Directors included the president, Louis S. Clarke, the secretary, John S. Clarke, as well as, James K. Clarke. Both Louis Semple Clarke and his brother John S. Clarke were members of the fabled South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club of Johnstown Flood fame.
Autocar founder Louis Semple Clarke (1867   1957) was a successful mechanical engineer.  Among Clarke's innovations were the spark plug for gasoline engines, a perfected drive shaft system for automobiles, and the first design of a useful oil circulation system.  Clarke's insistence of placing the driver on the left hand side of the vehicle led to that standardization throughout most of the automotive industry worldwide, and consequently we drive on the right side of the road. The patented porcelain-insulated spark plug process was sold to Champion and remains the industry standard.
Clarke was also a talented photographer.  His family were members of the elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club above Johnstown, Pennsylvania, whose earthen dam at Lake Conemaugh burst on May 31, 1889, causing the Johnstown Flood.
Clarke sold his interest in Autocar in 1929 and retired from business.  He died in Palm Beach, Florida, on January 6, 1957, and is buried in Allegheny Cemetery, in Pittsburgh.
The first car in 1900 was a single cylinder chain drive runabout. About 27 were made.
The 1904 Autocar was equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 4 passengers and sold for US$1700.  The horizontal-mounted flat-2, situated at the front of the car, produced 11&nbsp;hp (8.2&nbsp;kW).  This was a somewhat unusual engine design for the time, with most companies producing inline designs.  A 3-speed transmission was fitted.  The steel and wood-framed car weighed 1675&nbsp;lb (760&nbsp;kg). The early cars had tiller steering.
In 1905 the company was selling the Type XII car for $2,250 and another it called the Type X for $1,000. It discontinued the Type XI and sold the last of them in 1905. The cars now had wheel steering with left hand drive.
The Type X was a runabout. During the 1905-1906 model year the company produced 1000 Type X cars. The manufacture of 500 Type XV runabouts was authorized for 1907 in place of 500 touring cars (Type XIV) in addition to the 1000 runabouts already planned. At special meeting on June 19, 1906 held at 711 Arcade Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the board authorized the hiring of a general manager by the name of Harry A. Gillis at a salary of $10,000 per year. Production of 300 Type XVI cars and 500 Type XVII were authorized during a Board Meeting on November 21, 1906.
Commercial vehicles were made from 1907 and soon outnumbered cars.
As of 1911, Autocar was making only trucks. The first model had a 97-inch wheelbase, a one and a half ton capacity, and a 2-cylinder gasoline engine under the seat. Later, engines had 4 and 6 cylinders, and wheelbases became longer. Conventional engines became the company's focus.
In 1929, Autocar sold 3300 units, thought the number fell to 1000 in 1932 and continued to decline during the Great Depression. Larger trucks with "Blue Streak" gasoline engines and Diesel engines, mainly from Cummins, came later.
During World War II, Autocar supplied 50,000 units to the military; during its entire prewar history, the company had only built 70,000 units. Civilian production resumed in 1944 and sales increased greatly after the war. Autocar soon had 100 dealers.
However, the boom after the war ended quickly, and in 1953, Autocar sold out to White Motor Company. White replaced Blue Streak engines with its own Mustang, and production of gasoline-powered trucks ended in 1965.
The Ardmore plant was replaced in 1954 with a new plant in Exton, Pennsylvania, though the Ardmore plant burned while being torn down in 1956 and the fire could have  destroyed a neighborhood.
Autocar's "Custom Engineering" process for meeting each customer's needs led to a reputation as "World's Finest".
AP Off-road vehicles became an important product for Autocar. The 1964 AP19 shown in September 2007 at a Golden Age Truck Museum exhibit "has a GCW of 900,000 lbs, a 30,000lb front axle, planetary rear axles rated at 200,000 lbs, and was originally powered with a 525 HP Cummins V-12 diesel which was later replaced with a 6-cylinder Cummins KT rated at 750 HP."
The Exton plant ended production in 1980, with production moving to Ogden, Utah.
White was taken over in turn by Volvo in 1980 with Autocar continuing as a division. In 2001 Andrew Taitz purchased the company and structured it under '''Grand Vehicle Works Holdings''', which used the brand name for their line of trucks.
In 1953 White purchased Autocar, which continued thru to the 1970s as part of the "Big Four" White brands. In 1980, with White insolvent, AB Volvo acquired the U.S. assets and brands, to become Volvo-White LLC. Volvo produced trucks under both the White and Autocar brands, with a majority of Autocar products becoming cab over engine models which were also re-badged Western Star for sale in the Canadian market through the early 1990s.
Volvo-White bought GMC's heavy truck business in 1987 creating the '''Volvo WhiteGMC''' brand. Volvo dropped any reference to White, and is now '''Volvo Trucks North America'''.
The last traditional Autocar with a "Custom Driver Cab" was made in Ogden on December 18, 1987. After that, Autocars were made in the style of other Volvo-White products, with the bow-tie emblem on the radiator and hood side panels. The name changed to Volvo-Autocar in 1996.
Autocar remained a part of Volvo until 2000, when the marque was withdrawn from the market. After Volvo acquired the North American operations of Renault Trucks in 2001, as the merged company would have an excess/uncompetitive share of the refuse truck market sector, Volvo agreed to sell select vehicle designs for the Xpeditor low cab forward heavy duty product, intellectual properties and the Autocar Company brand rights to Highland Park, Illinois based ''Grand Vehicle Works Holdings, LLC'' (GVW).
The Autocar company now employs 200 at its manufacturing facility in Hagerstown, Indiana. In 2003 Autocar and UAW entered into a contract to officaly Unionize the facility.  UAW LOCAL 3050 was then ratified. http://www.local3050.org The company produces LCF Class 8 trucks, primarily for refuse and waste disposal. The company   s Xpeditor product line offers state-of-the-art features ranging from improved ergonomic cabs, integrated controls, and a new hybrid drive refuse truck. The company has a nationwide service network in the US. Autocar   s customer base includes large fleets, private fleets and municipalities in the United States and Canada.
