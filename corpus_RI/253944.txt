Kaluga was founded in the mid-14th century as a border fortress on the southwestern borders of the Muscovy. It was first mentioned by its present name in 1371. In the Middle Ages, Kaluga was a minor settlement owned by the Princes Vorotynsky. The ancestral home of these princes is located south-west from the modern city.
Kaluga is connected to Moscow by a railway line and the ancient roadway, the Kaluga road (now partly within Moscow (as   ), partly the A101 road). This road was the favoured escape route from the Moscow trap for Napoleon in the fall of 1812. But General Kutuzov repelled Napoleon's advances in this direction and forced the retreating French army onto the old Smolensk road, previously devastated by the French during their invasion of Russia.
Kaluga was occupied by the Nazi armies in 1941.
In 1944 the Soviet Government used its local military buildings to intern hundreds of Polish POW - soldiers of the Polish Underground Home Army, who were arrested by advancing Soviet front in the Vilno district.
In recent years Kaluga has become one of the centers of the Russian automotive industry, with a number of foreign companies opening assembly plants in the area.
On November&nbsp;28, 2007, Volkswagen Group opened a new assembly plant in Kaluga, with further expansion plans planned to be completed by, or during, 2009.  The investment has reached more than 500 million Euro.  The plant currently assembles the Volkswagen Passat and Skoda Octavia.  Planned annual capacity from 2009: up to 150,000 vehicles.
On October&nbsp;15, 2007, the Volvo Group broke ground on a new truck assembly plant, scheduled to be finished in early 2009.  Once completed the plant is expected to have yearly capacity of 10,000 Volvo and 5,000 Renault trucks.
On December&nbsp;12, 2007, PSA Peugeot Citroen announced its decision to build a new assembly plant in Kaluga. By March 2010 the plant was operational, building Peugeot 308s for the Russian market and would also produce Citroen and Mitsubishi models.
Public transportation is represented by the trolleybuses, buses, and ''marshrutkas''.
