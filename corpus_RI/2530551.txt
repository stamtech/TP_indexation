The company was formerly owned and operated by Bournemouth Borough Council and was known as '''Yellow Buses Bournemouth''', and prior to that "Bournemouth Transport Ltd". The name was changed to '''Transdev Yellow Buses''' (TYB) when Transdev bought the company in December 2005. On 2 July 2006, Transdev Yellow Buses redesigned its entire network. It concentrated on core, higher frequency services, with a corresponding colour coded map, aimed at making the network easier for the public. In parallel, Transdev simplified its fare structure and introduced a new livery. This remains largely yellow (a condition of the sale), albeit in a lighter shade of primrose rather than the more mustard of old; "The Brighter Bus Company" became the new strap line. Transdev's new network also provides a number of lower-frequency, non-core routes.
Further changes have followed, with the fare prices being altered, along with extension of routes and new routes being introduced.
The company is arguably one of the most successful bus operators in England with a patronage growth of 40% since 2005 and currently carrying 13 million passengers per annum.
In May 2010 an agreement was signed for the transfer of Yellow Buses (and also London United) to a Transdev shareholder (the RATP Group) set for the early part of 2011. On Thursday 3 March 2011, both companies became part of the RATP Group.
With the passing of the Transport Act 1985 and subsequent deregulation and privatisation of bus services, ''Yellow Buses Bournemouth'' became an arms-length commercial company, wholly owned by Bournemouth Borough Council. In spite of the sale of other municipal operators, the Conservative-controlled council decided to hold on to its operator for the time being. Following a change of council control to the Liberal Democrats, council financial pressures in the years to 2005, a perceived need to modernise the fleet and a realisation that full privatisation would better equip the operator to overcome the increasing competition it was facing from Wilts & Dorset, the council offered the company for sale. 
The sale process was a difficult one but, after over 100 years of municipal operation, Bournemouth Borough Council sold Yellow Buses in December 2005 to Transdev. The Council retained 10 per cent of the shareholding and a member on the Transdev Yellow Buses board.
Transdev then decided to make its mark on Yellow Buses by giving the entire network a complete overhaul. This became the Big Network Change of 2 July 2006, where each bus, each journey, and each route (even route numbers) was changed. To make sure that the public were made aware of these changes, Transdev Yellow Buses held road shows across Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch to publicise its new network, livery, branding and new fare structure. Since then, Transdev have made slight changes to the network with funding from Bournemouth Borough Council, including the introduction of routes 37 and 38, the extension of Route 41 at both ends to Boscombe Pier and to Throop Church, and the re-introduction of Route 24 to Bournemouth and to bring back the route in the evenings and on Sundays between the Rail Station and Alum Chine. Also, for the first time in recent years, Transdev Yellow Buses decided not to run services on New Year's Day 2007 except route 747, which ran a normal Monday service.
A revised timetable was introduced on Sunday 22 July 2007 and Monday 29 October 2007 saw TYB take over the operation of Routes 18 and 19 from Wilts & Dorset, combining them to make new route 18 between Broadstone and Bournemouth. Unlike the old Wilts & Dorset route, there is no service between Broadstone and Corfe Mullen, and no Sunday or evening buses.
Transdev Yellow Buses have invested in a Real Time & Next Stop display system. Screens have already been put in most of the low-floor fleet and it is now in operation (from end of April 2008) on all routes where the equipment has been installed.
In May 2008, new route 39 was started, with the help of Bournemouth Borough Council, when a timetable change saw Littledown/Harewood Estates with no service. This is an hourly service running between Bournemouth Hospital and Bournemouth via Boscombe.
Another revision to the timetable took place on 3 May 2009, with various improvements on routes 1 and 3 and many timing changes. Sunday 24 May saw the start of a brand new hourly Route 21 service, taking over from the Wilts & Dorset Route X12 Bournemouth to Burton service and part of the C1 (the other part along with the C2 being run by Shamrock Buses).
27 September 2009 saw the start of a new winter timetable with changes to routes 1, 6, and 25, and the merging of Routes 37 and 38 to make new route 36.
April 2010 saw TYB expand services into East Dorset with the launch of an hourly Route 29 between Bournemouth, Winton, Ferndown and West Moors.
May 2010 saw that start of three new services being the 20, 27 (both on May 4) and 40 (May 29).
Route 20, which is a merge of routes 53 (operated by Wilts & Dorset) and 42 (operated by Shamrock Buses) will run between Poole and Castlepoint via Lilliput, Penn Hill, Square (Bourne Avenue), Winton and West Way.
Route 27 will run between Kinson and Poole via Bear Wood and Alderney and is a commercial replacement for Wilts & Dorset's Route 11 (although W&D will still be running the service as normal on Sundays and will run a services between Poole and Bear Wood on Mondays to Fridays). Route 27 will run hourly Monday to Saturday.
Route 40 will run between Christchurch Civic Offices and Bournemouth Square/Pier. This is a partial replacement to the old Route 12 service, although it will be run with single-deck buses and not Open Top Double Deckers. It will run via Tuckton Bridge, Hengistbury Head and Boscombe Pier. This day will also see some minor changes to Route 39.
June 6, 2010 was the start of the new summer timetable with changes to routes 1, 3, 4, 6, 18, 24 and 36.
On 3 March 2011 Yellow Buses changed hands officially, from Transdev to the RATP Group.
May 15, 2011 saw a few changes made to routes 1, 3 & 5, either in frequency or timing, to which June 26th, 2011 will see the start of the new summer timetable with changes to all routes including withdrawing routes 24, 29 & 49, however, routes 24 & 29 will be replaced with various other routes. (according to the latest VOSA document)
Over recent years, Bournemouth Transport/ Yellow Buses, its management and staff have picked up a few awards. 
Yellow Buses has seen many changes over the years, particularly to do with route numbers. Please see the above page for all previous routes, current and future information.
Yellow Buses has a mixture of different vehicle types. Since Transdev acquired the company, most of the fleet has been renewed and is now almost entirely low-floor.
In the 1980s the fleet mainly consisted of Daimler/Leyland Fleetlines (most of which had unusual Alexander AL type bodies as opposed to the AD type) and Leyland Atlanteans. 20 Leyland Olympians with Marshall bodies (the only ones of their kind) were also owned, as were a small number of Ford Transit minibuses. Some of the Daimler/Leyland Fleetlines were convertible open-top buses for what was once an extensive summer service.
Five Volvo Citybuses, five with East Lancs coach-style bodywork were purchased in 1986 (fleet numbers 200 to 204 inclusive). They spent much of their time in what was then the coaching division of the Yellows..."Yellow Coaches of Bournemouth". They eventually made their way to the Yellow Buses fleet and into regular service. Ten Volvo Citybuses with Alexander RV-type bodies were bought, five in 1988 (fleet numbers 205 to 209 inclusive) and a further five in 1989 (210 to 214 inclusive).
18 Dennis Dominators with East Lancs E-type bodies (built to Alexander R-type design) were purchased, and have turbo-charged Gardner 6LXCT engines: seven in 1990 (fleet numbers 251 to 257 inclusive), seven in 1991 (fleet numbers 258, 259 and 261 to 265 inclusive) and four in 1992 (fleet numbers 266 to 269 inclusive). Six East Lancs EL2000-bodied Dennis Lances were bought in 1993 (fleet numbers 401 to 406 inclusive).
In 1995/6, a large batch of Dennis Darts with East Lancs EL2000 bodywork were purchased, and are worth noting as the bodies are wider than usual Darts (regardless of bodywork): 12 in 1995 (fleet numbers 451 to 462 inclusive) and 10 in 1996 (fleet numbers 463 to 472 inclusive). In the 1995 batch, fleet numbers 451, 452, 453 and 454 were originally in Super Route 17 livery, complete with Real Time equipment. 
In 1997/8, delivery of Dennis Dart SLFs with East Lancs Spryte bodywork: two in 1997 (fleet numbers 473 and 474) and eight in 1998 (fleet numbers 475 to 482 inclusive). The 1998 batch were originally in "Super Route 6" livery. In 1999 Yellow Buses took delivery of its first new double decks since 1992, being nine East Lancs Lolyne-bodied Dennis Tridents (fleet numbers 270 to 278 inclusive).
Yellow Buses took delivery six Volvo B7TLs in 2003, the bodywork of which were split equally between East Lancs Vyking (fleet numbers 426 to 428 inclusive) and Wright Eclipse Gemini (fleet numbers 180 to 182 inclusive). Again, this year also saw another one of the original 18 Dennis Dominator/East Lancs E Types taken out of service. The company withdrew all six East Lancs EL2000-bodied Dennis Lances. The Leyland Fleetlines in the fleet were sold to Thamesdown between 2003 and 2006.
The only deliveries in 2004 were a further six further Volvo B7TLs, yet again equally split between East Lancs, this time with East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodywork (fleet numbers 110 to 112 inclusive), and Wright Eclipse Gemini (fleet numbers 183 to 185 inclusive).
A further three East Lancs Myllennium Vyking Volvo B7TLs arrived in 2005 (fleet numbers 113 to 115 inclusive), plus four VDL SB120/Wright Merits (fleet numbers 500 to 503), the latter in a revised livery (before the sale to Transdev) of yellow and white relieved with two blue upward sweeping bands to the rear.
In 2007 the company commenced repainting the remainder of the Volvo Citybuses, but this has now stopped since the company is looking into purchasing some double deckers. By the end of October, fleet numbers 205 and 206 had been sold.
The driver training fleet has also been changed. The company withdrew the last two East Lancs EL2000-bodied Dennis Lances (fleet numbers 402 and 406). In their place, the 1997 batch of Dennis Dart SLFs with East Lancs Spryte bodywork (fleet numbers 473 and 474) have been painted up in special yellow and purple driver training livery.
A single deck Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Dart (with a 57 registration) went into service in mid-January 2008, numbered 515. In September 2008, 11 brand new Optare Versas arrived at the depot. These have registrations to match their fleet numbers in the Txx TYB range (18 to 28 inclusive) and entered service on Route 1a (Bournemouth-Somerford) on 1 October 2008. In November, an order was announced for 11 Optare Tempos to follow on from the Versa order.
Towards the end of the year, Dennis Dart East Lancs EL2000s 460 to 463 were withdrawn and put up for sale with Ensign Bus; one has since joined The Big Lemon in Brighton.
Your Bus was also launched during September 2008 by TYB, to run the school specials they have contracts for, and currently there are 3 Volvo Citybuses (208, 211, 213) and one Dennis Dart East Lancs EL2000 (being 465) in the TYB "Your Bus" Livery. This fleet was expanded in September 2009 with the introduction of the Bournemouth & Poole College School Contract with extra Darts and an extra Volvo Citybus added to the fleet.
During the early part of 2009, Wright Crusader 156 was withdrawn for spares, and replacement bus 514, a 51 plate DAF SB120/Wright Cadet, entered service towards the end of June 2009. Its number plate is YJ51 ELX.
Eleven Optare Tempos entered service during May 2009. They, like the Optare Versas, have registrations to match their fleet numbers in the Rxx TYB range (7 to 17 inclusive)
The early part of 2010 saw the withdrawal of the remaining Volvo Citybuses that are not currently in the Your Bus section of TYB.
Spring 2010 has seen the refurbishment of the Trident Lolynes (270 - 278 inclusive) with 270 first back from the refurbishment. Notable differences are the addition of a wheelchair ramp and area, more stop buttons on both decks, flooring to the same specification as the Optare single-deckers already in the fleet, new seating with different arrangements both on the lower and especially the upper deck where the seats are now spaced further apart, increasing leg-room, slightly reducing capacity, and improving CCTV.
June 2010 has seen the introduction of seven new Optare Tempos, fleet numbers 101 to 107 inclusive.
Spring 2011 saw the continuation of the refurbishment of the fleet with the East Lancs Myllennium Vykings (fleet numbers 110 to 115 inclusive) and the Wright Eclipse Geminis (fleet numbers 180 to 185 inclusive) receiving new flooring, seating and improved CCTV. 5 new Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2s arrived in May 2011.
In September 2002, Yellow Buses decided to use Old Christchurch Road for most outbound journeys, but use Bath Road for inbound journeys. Buses in both directions in the evenings and on Sundays, however, used Bath Road. The poster to the right illustrates the changes. Services unaffected by this re-routing were 22 and 69, which used Hinton Road and Bath Road all day, every day.
Some years later, Yellow Buses decided to change some town centre routing further. This managed to confuse some of its drivers. It included buses towards Lansdowne operating via Old Christchurch Road each day (except for routes 22 and 69, as above), including Sundays, and then all buses towards Lansdowne using Hinton Road and Bath Road after 6.00 pm.
This was changed slightly again when Transdev carried out their Big Network Change of July 2006, so that all buses towards Lansdowne before 6.00 pm operated via Old Christchurch Road. From 22 July 2007, all buses towards Lansdowne before 8.00 pm now operate via Old Christchurch Road.
The end of September 2009 saw a minor change to the town centre re-routing with all Route 6 buses running via Hinton Road and Bath Road instead of Old Christchurch Road all day.
Since Transdev took over Yellow Buses in 2005, there has been some controversy which has been reported by the Daily Echo, the local newspaper. Some people say that they are having a harder time getting buses, having to walk longer distances to walk to bus stops and are not happy about some old and overcrowded buses being used, even though the fleet was updated from the fleet the ones 'old Yellow Buses' used.
There has however been a 20% increase in passenger numbers and many have welcomed the simplified route network and fare system, new high frequency extended services, improved bus stop flags and timetables, cheaper promotional tickets and the fleet of mostly modern low floor vehicles.
In some areas bus services were withdrawn due to lack of demand and were replaced by more popular and profitable routes such as those to Poole. The non-profitable routes were taken away though, suggesting the company's profit influence, instead of thinking about people in general in the lower demand areas. It has, however, enabled the company to focus its resources on providing a more popular efficient service for the majority, including higher frequency services where needed. -->
