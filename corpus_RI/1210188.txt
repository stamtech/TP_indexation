The reason for having an article for every one of them is simple: If a person has a wife, child and father, and he is not supposed to have and article by himself, then the relative small info that we have on him must be duplicated to every notable relative he has. And that would just clog all those articles with info that is not very relevant for them. And take up much more space than just adding any info to each person. Note that when a Sahaba narrates a hadith, even if there is no info on the sahaba himself, it can help to see in which family he was brought up in and which people he associated with. further, if following a family tree from one person to another, it is important to have an unbroken chain to see how everybody are related. That is not possible if everybody don't have their own family tree. The alternative would be to have one HUGE family tree of 100 000 people, but that would be unreadable, even if ti where in 3D.
