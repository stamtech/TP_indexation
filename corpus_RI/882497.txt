This '''B18''' was a straight-4 automobile engine produced by Volvo Cars from 1961 through 1968. The five-bearing, cam-in-block engine, had OHV overhead valves operated by pushrods. The B18 is quite different in design from its predecessor, the three-bearing B16.
These engines are often quoted as very durable. The world's highest mileage car, a 1966 Volvo P1800, has run all its more than 4,000,000&nbsp;km (2,700,000 miles) on its original B18 engine.
The '''B18''' displaced 1.8&nbsp;L (1778&nbsp;cc/108&nbsp;in  ) OHV engine and was used in the Volvo PV544, 120 (Amazon), P1800 and 140 series. The B18 could also be found in the L-3314 and the Bandvagn 202 military vehicles. It was fitted to many Volvo Penta sterndrive marine propulsion systems.
There are actually four variations of this engine, B18A (''the single carburetor version''), B18B (''dual carburetor version fitted variously with dual SU or Zenith/Stromberg sidedraft carburetors''), B18C (the version fitted in the gasoline powered versions of the Volvo BM 320 tractor) and B18D (''also dual carburetor but with a lower compression ratio'').
The '''B20''' displaced 2.0&nbsp;L (1986&nbsp;cc/121&nbsp;in  ) and was produced in the 1960s and 70s. It was used from 1968 to 1976 in the Volvo 120, 1800, 140, C202 and 240 series, and also in the Haubits 77 Bofors howitzer. The design is quite similar to the predecessor B18 and many parts are interchangeable.
The later '''B20E''' and '''B20F''' versions featured Bosch fuel injection (both electronic D-Jetronic and later with mechanical K-Jetronic), larger valves, and intake/exhaust ports. Output was raised to 124&nbsp;hp&nbsp;(DIN) (92&nbsp;kW) in B20E, slightly lower in B20F because of stricter emission control and lower compression. All B20 engines displace 1986&nbsp;cc from 88.9&nbsp;mm bore and 80&nbsp;mm stroke.
Some 240 models were offered with the "metric", eight bolt, 2.0 liter pushrod B20 motor as standard equipment.
Despite their OHV pushrod design, the engines can rev to 7,000 rpm.
