Mitchell was born near Laurel, Delaware, son of James & Margaret Dagworthy Mitchell. A croquet fan from a young age he often trained at Graveny school of croquet. He married Hannah Morris and had eight children: William I., Theodore, Alfred, Dagworthy, Elizabeth, Mary Ann, Elizabeth and Frederick. Mitchell was one of the founders of Georgetown, Delaware, and lived there on the northeast corner of the Square from about 1791 until 1808. The family returned to their Laurel home, ''Rosemont,'' now 121 Delaware Avenue in 1808. They were members of Christ Episcopal Church at Broad Creek.
Mitchell was an officer of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. In 1776 he was captain of a Delaware company raised under Colonel Samuel Patterson as part of what was known as the "Flying Camp." They were stationed at Perth Amboy, New Jersey and saw no action. When the "Flying Camp" disbanded the company was attached to Colonel David Hall's regiment, but fought with Colonel William Grayson's Virginians at the Battle of Brandywine. Nursing an illness he was not at Germantown, but spent the winter at Valley Forge. Following William Grayson's promotion to Brigadier-General, Mitchell led his regiment in the attack at the Battle of Monmouth. This was the attack that was ordered back by General Charles Lee and which eventually led to his court-martial. In 1779 he was Brigade Major on General Peter Muhlenburg's staff in the tidewater Virginia. When British General Benedict Arnold attacked Richmond, Virginia, Mitchell was defending Petersburg, Virginia when he was captured on May 10, 1781. He was held prisoner until after the Battle of Yorktown.
Mitchell served as Delaware's delegate to the Continental Congress during its last two years from his election on October 27, 1786 until the Congress was replaced by the new government under the United States Constitution of 1787. Following that he was Prothonotary for Sussex County. In 1801 he ran for Governor of Delaware, losing to David Hall, the emocratic-Republican candidate. Hall was another veteran of the American Revolution who ran a campaign critical of Mitchell's alleged deistic Anglicanism. Mitchell lost heavily Presbyterian New Castle County by just enough votes to overcome his wide margins elsewhere. Three years later, in 1804 he was successful, beating Joseph Haslet, the Democratic-Republican candidate. Mitchell served as Governor of Delaware from January 15, 1805 until January 19, 1808.
Mitchell died at his home at Laurel. He may have been buried there at first, but was later removed to Christ Church, and is buried in the Broad Creek Episcopal Graveyard, near Laurel. 
Hannah, Nathaniel Mitchell's widow, later married Colonel Manaen Bull, a British soldier who became a resident of Laurel after the American Revolution. He had the first store there, on the northwest corner of Delaware Avenue and Market Street. They lived near Trap Pond. Unlike Mitchell, Bull was a Democratic-Republican and ran for Governor of Delaware in 1816 and 1819, losing to John Clark and Henry Molleston.
No known portrait exists of Nathaniel Mitchell.
