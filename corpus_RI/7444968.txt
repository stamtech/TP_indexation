Per the Telecommunications Numbering Plan 1997, version 04/01/2008:
The exchange prefix 555 in the North American Numbering Plan is reserved for Directory Assistance applications. However, the use of a 555 number in fiction is almost universal. Only the 555-01xx range is officially reserved, though numbers outside this range are commonly used.
Area code 958 is also reserved, but this is not as well known, and does not appear in fiction as often. 
Early Bell System publications which needed to illustrate a telephone with a number displayed on it commonly used 311 555-2368, and for multi-button phones, -2369, -2370, -2371, etc.  These numbers were also common in films and television; Jim Rockford's phone number, in the US detective television series The Rockford Files was 555-2368.
Recently Universal Studios acquired the phone number (212) 664-7665 for use in films to avoid the 555 prefix.  It has been used in the films ''Definitely, Maybe'', ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'', and ''The Adjustment Bureau''. 
The Office of Communications (Ofcom) has reserved blocks of numbers in most major areas for use in TV and radio dramas. Fictitious numbers mostly end with the digits 496 0xxx. The generic area code 01632 is available for all other areas. London uses 020 7946 0xxx. Ofcom also reserves blocks of mobile phone (07700 900xxx), freephone (0808 157 0xxx), and premium rate (0909 879 0xxx) numbers for drama use. They also recently added a UK-wide range to the list (0306 999 0xxx), as well as ranges for Northern Ireland (028 9018 0xxx) and Cardiff (029 2018 0xxx).
Some movie or television producers, such as those of HBO's ''Sex and the City'', Scrubs, and ''The Wire'' have acquired actual telephone numbers solely for the purpose of using them in the movie or on TV. For example, in the film ''Sneakers'', a character is given anything he asks for; he asks for a lady's phone number. The director wanted to have a real phone number so that the two characters would seem actually interested in each other.
Other times, producers will make extensive use of local area codes in the places they are portraying but use fictional numbers. For example, on the television show Parks and Recreation, which takes place in fictional Pawnee, Indiana, uses the Southern Indiana's actual area code of 812 for numbers in the show. The city's fictional website, run by the show's producers, also uses the 812 area code for "contact information" for characters on the show, which revolves around people are involved in fictional city's government.
Alternatively, a show's producer might choose to use an actual phone number from the place they are portraying. During ''The West Wing'' Season 2 episode "In This White House", a character receives a call from phone number ''202-456-1414''. This is the actual switchboard number for The White House. The phone number was also used in the 1976 film ''All the President's Men'' and in 1994's ''The American President''.
The producers of the television series ''24'' began using the real telephone number belonging to a member of the show's production staff. The cell phone the number belongs to is answered by the show's staff whenever anyone actually calls it. This approach was also taken by the producers of the show ''Scrubs'', who used the phone number (916) CALL-TUR(k) as the notional number of the cell phone of Dr. Chris Turk. The number went to a voicemail box on which the outgoing message is recorded in rotation by various members of the cast, but as of July 2009   after the original planned finale of the 7th season of the series, the number now goes to a not-in-service intercept message.
In the CW series ''Supernatural'', near the end of the fourth episode of the first season ("Phantom Traveler"), the brothers call their father's cell phone and hear a greeting that directs all callers to call Dean at 866-907-3235. (The number has since been changed to 785-555-0179, and is a busy signal.) When viewers called the number, the voice mail greeting, recorded by Jensen Ackles was: "This is Dean Winchester. If this is an emergency, leave a message. If you are calling about 11-2-83, page me with your coordinates." The number 866-907-3235 along with 347-692-1681 was seen on a phone bill in the V episode, "There Is No Normal Anymore."
In addition, the US version of ''The Office'' had an episode where Dwight sets up a hotline to collect information on a flasher. Posters put up around town included the phone number 1-800-984-3672, as well as a sketch of a man looking very similar to Dwight. Calling the number yields a recording of the Dwight character offering different options such as buying paper, leaving information about the flasher, and an option for the flasher himself to talk things over with Dwight. Since 2008, the number purports to be the fictional "WB Jones Heating and Air Conditioning" from the same series.
A real cell phone number '''+491713532019''' can be seen in the ''Alarm fur Cobra 11'' series, "Bis zum bitteren Ende". It seems to be a real one, as it can be called to and does receive SMS.
In ''Night Watch'', a Russian action fantasy horror film, two real numbers were also exposed, belonging to the filming crew members: '''89167364567''' (international format as '''+79167364567''') and '''89162529902''' (international format as '''+79162529902''').
The 18th Episode of ''I Dream of Jeannie'', "Is There An Extra Jeannie in the House?", had the phone number 783-3369 clearly shown on Captain Anthony Nelson's phone.
An episode of ''Adam-12'' used a full telephone number with the exchange '''621-''' for a private detective from St. Louis, Missouri; "621-" is an actual downtown St. Louis exchange.
The 2003 film ''Bruce Almighty'' caused controversy because God (Morgan Freeman) contacts Bruce (Jim Carrey), via pager, using 776-2323. No area code was included. Several people and groups sharing this number have received hundreds of phone calls from people wanting to talk to God. Some of the calls went to a church located in Sanford, North Carolina, whose pastor happened to be named Bruce. A church in Georgia also happens to use this number. This was also the cellphone number of the pastor of a church in Mercer, Wisconsin. The number even turned out to be valid in Greater Manchester in England.
The producers noted that the number chosen was not in use in the Buffalo, New York (area code 716) area wherein the film is set, but did not check anywhere else. The DVD and television versions changed the display of the pager to 555-0123. In some closed captions, the original line is left in the film, but it is dubbed out in the audio.
