The channel is produced in a partnership between KOCE and Chapman University with programming consisting of Orange County news, local events information, weather and traffic. The channel's format consists of a L frame shaped area on the screen, which features live traffic cameras from Caltrans, current temperature/time and a news headlines crawl on the bottom of the screen. The remaining and larger portion of the screen provides viewers with local public affairs/news programs and documentaries. The channel can be viewed in Orange County, Los Angeles County, Ventura County and portions of San Bernardino County & Riverside County to viewers able to receive digital broadcasts. The channel is also available on Cox Communications in Orange County.
