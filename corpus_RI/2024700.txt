In 2007 World Series of Poker, Antonius entered numerous tournaments but he only cashed in the World Championship of Pot Limit Omaha event, placing third and winning $311,394, making that his ninth WSOP cash and increasing his WSOP earnings to a total of $569,964. Antonius has been featured three times on NBC's Poker After Dark. In his first appearance he finished as runner up, losing out to fellow poker professional Jennifer Harman, but his next attempt saw him defeat Brad Booth in heads-up play to take the victory. In his third appearance he was runner up again, this time to Johnny Chan. As of 2010, Antonius' total live tournament winnings exceed $2,800,000. His 13 cashes at the WSOP account for $774,046 of those winnings. 
Antonius was not able to enter the 2009 WSOP Main Event, as he was turned away when attempting to register along with hundreds of others due to a capacity field.  
He also plays in some of the highest profile online tournaments, and in September 2008 he finished 2nd in the Full Tilt Poker $25,000 buy-in Heads-Up Pot Limit Omaha Championship, winning $320,000.
 He is a regular high stakes player online and one of the most successful having won millions of dollars. He has played on Full Tilt Poker under several nicknames, including ''Luigi66369'', ''CryMeRiver9'' and ''Finddagrind'', but having become a member of "Team Full Tilt" he now plays under his real name. During his early career he also used screen names e.g. ''I_knockout_U'', ''try_hrdr_fish'' and ''-ANTONIUS-'' on various other poker networks. Previously Antonius was one of a team of players associated with Martinspoker.com. 
He is equally prolific in live cash games, and is a regular in the Big Game, the high-stakes cash game at the Bellagio. Antonius appeared on the third to sixth seasons of GSN's High Stakes Poker. Patrik was involved, along with Sammy Farha, in the show's largest ever pot; it totaled $998,800. After a preflop raise and re-raise the flop came ; Antonius held  for top pair and Farha held , giving him two over-cards and a flush draw. Sammy called Patrik's all-in raise instantly and the two agreed to run the turn and river four times. Though Sammy's hand was a slight favorite, Patrik won three of the four runs and collected $749,100.
In another sizable pot on High Stakes Poker, Patrik went up against Jamie Gold. Jamie had  versus Patrik's . Patrik raised to $4,000 preflop with Jamie reraising to $14,000, after declaring that his hole cards felt "like aces." The flop came out , giving Patrik an inside straight draw. Jamie bet $15,000 into a $30,800 pot, which Patrik called. The turn was the , giving Patrik a straight and Jamie a set of kings. Patrik bet $45,000 into the pot, which Jamie reraised all in. Patrik immediately called making the pot worth $743,800. The players agreed to run the river three times. Despite being a 77-23 favorite, Patrik won only the last of the three times, as Jamie hit a full house on the first two. Even after losing two times as a favorite, Patrik remained calm and showed no emotion on his face. At the time, it was the largest pot ever on High Stakes Poker.
Antonius has since lost an almost 600,000 dollar pot to Tom Dwan on a Poker After Dark high stakes cash game. Tom straddled the hand to 1,200 and Patrik was first to act having pocket 10's, with which he raised. Tom reraised the hand with pocket K's, and Patrik called. The flop gave him a set of tens and he bet 27,000, which Tom called. The turn was a K, giving Tom a set of K's. Patrik bet 59,000 which led to Dwan going all-in for over 200,000, which Patrik called, making the pot almost 600,000. They ran it twice, Patrik losing both. It was the largest pot in the history of Poker After Dark.
Antonius is the first player to go up against Tom Dwan in his "Million Dollar Challenge" on Full Tilt Poker (though not the first to accept the challenge). Dwan has challenged players to high-stakes no-limit hold 'em or pot-limit Omaha at Full Tilt, playing four tables at a time heads-up for a total of 50,000 hands. Dwan has put up $1.5 million to any opponent's $500,000; the player who is ahead after 50,000 hands will win the money put up by his opponent, plus any winnings from play in the challenge.
In November 2009, Antonius won the biggest pot in online poker history, $1,356,946 against Isildur1, who was revealed in January 2011 to be Swedish player Viktor Blom.
