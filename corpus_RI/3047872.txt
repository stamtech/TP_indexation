As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $900,000.

Lodden has cashed eight times at the European Poker Tour, making one final table at the 2008 event in Budapest. In the 2008 PokerStars.com EPT Grand Final in Monte Carlo, Lodden was chip leader much of the tournament but ended up in 17th place earning    46,300 ($73,797).
Lodden came in 11th place at the 2008 World Series of Poker Europe Main Event, earning   54,300 ($86,880).  He cashed in one event at the 2009 World Series of Poker before making a deep run in the 2010 World Series of Poker Main Event.
Lodden's name is associated with the game "'''Lodden Thinks'''" in which two bettors place bets on what a third party thinks the answer to a given question is. For example, the third party will be asked how old he thinks a particular person is or how much a particular item costs; before revealing his answer however, the two others will place bets on what they think the third party's answer will be. This game was popularized during the World Series of Poker Europe when Phil Laak and Antonio Esfandiari played the game, with Johnny Lodden as the third party.
