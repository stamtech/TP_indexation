Route 258 was introduced on 30 October 1971 and replaced route 182 between Watford & Harrow Weald and since 1978, continued to South Harrow replacing route 114.
Route 258 was originally allocated to Harrow Weald garage using single and double deckers. The contract was won by London Country North West in 1990, but they had been taken over by Luton & District by the time they started its operation in 1991. They operated the route from their Garston (Watford) garage. Route 258 was moved to Southall in 1996 for its new contract to London Buslines.
London Buslines was later closed and moved within the First Group to Centrewest operated from the Alperton (ON) garage in 1999; using ex-London Buslines's Darts with yellow livery and Dennis Dart SLF 10.2m/Marshall Capitals (DML's) from route 92 and route T32. Route 258 was converted to double decks in 2001, first using Dennis Trident 2 9.9m/Plaxton President, later these buses moved to Westbourne Park (X) and Northumberland Park (NP) and replaced by Volvo B7TL 10m/Wright Eclipse Gemini (VNW) but some Volvo B7TL 10.6m/Plaxton President (VNL) and Volvo Olympians from route 83 did come up.
In 2006, the operation was transferred back to Arriva The Shires from Watford garage.
