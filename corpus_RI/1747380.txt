Fort Foureau is the hazardous waste disposal project located in the African country of Mali and run by Yves Massarde. Fort Foureau handles biological and chemical waste and burns it using two quartz burners. The project is powered by solar-photon technology.
The project has a number of solar panels which collect sunlight and store it in power modules ready to be used in the chemical incinerators.
The destruction of the chemical and biological waste is done by solar concentrators. The first reactor focuses the high-intensity sunlight onto the waste and is broken down into harmless chemicals. at a temperature of 950 degrees Celsius. The second reactor incinerates the remaining material at a temperature of 1200 degrees Celsius.
Fort Foureau is only designed to burn chemical and biological waste. However, Yves Massarde has an illegal underground storage vault built to put nuclear waste in. The waste is stored in inferior canisters and begins to leak out. Any person who discovers the vault is sent to the Tebezza gold mine.
