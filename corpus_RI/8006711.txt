The '''Geologic map of Georgia''' is a 1:500,000 scale map, that was produced in 1976 by the Georgia Geological Survey.  The map was produced on a base map produced by the United States Geological Survey.  The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia at that time was .  The map was put together mainly in two parts from two teams representing the northern and southern portion of the state.  The northern portion was compiled by the team of geologist, D. E. Lawton, who headed this team, F. J. Moye, J. B Murray, M. J. O   Connor, H. m. Penley, and G. S. Sandrock from the Geological Survey of Georgia.  The southern portion of the state was compiled by at team from the state Geological Survey, W. E. Marsalis, who headed this team, M. S. Fridell, J. H. Hetrick, P. F. Huddlestun, R. E. Hunter, W.R. Mann, B. F. Martin, Jr., S. M. Pickering, Jr., F. J. Schneeberger, and J. D. Wilson (Pickering, 1976).
The geologic map of Georgia is actually a compilation of numerous geological studies and mapping projects that have occurred throughout the state and over an extended time period.  The major studies that are cited as to their contribution to the state geologic map fall under three main categories, new mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey, new mapping by the Georgia Geological Survey combined with revised published maps, and published maps with compilation revision only.  See the data source map for the location and regions of published and unpublished maps.  The majority of the rock units shown on the 1976 map were mapped in 1973 by reconnaissance methods.  For some areas previous authors had more detailed work than what was conducted by the geological survey staff so these areas the original author   s work was used to created the geologic map.

The first statewide geologic map for the state of Georgia was published in 1825.  It was a 1:1,000,000 scale map of Georgia and Alabama published by H.S. Tanner (Lawton and Pierce, 1972).  In 1849 W.T. Williams published the geological features for the state on a 1:120,000 scale map within George White   s (1849) Statistics of the State of Georgia report.  Then in 1871 M.F. Stephenson published a 1:1,200,000 scale map of the Geology and mineralogy of Georgia that was published by the Globe Publishing Company of Atlanta.  This map was part of a report with the same name (Lawton and Pierce, 1972).  Another statewide map of the geology of Georgia was published in 1876 by G. Little in the Handbook of the State of Georgia by T.P. Janes (1876).  In 1885 J.T. Henderson produced a 1:2,500,000 scale map of the geology of Georgia.  In 1895 R. T. Nesbitt produced a small-scale geological map of Georgia that was included in a statistical review of the state.  This report was a Chamber-of-Commerce styled work that reviewed the economic mineral resources and geology of the state.  This was the last statewide geological map published in the 19th Century.
Within the 20th Century there were three statewide geological maps produced prior to the 1976 map.  The first was a 1&nbsp;inch to 15 mile map produced by S.W. McCallie in 1908.  In 1939, George Willis Stose et al. produced a 1:500,000 scale map that was published by the Georgia Geologic Survey and the United States Geological Survey.  This map was reprinted in 1960 by the U.S. Geological Survey.  The third map was published in 1968 by the Geological Survey of Georgia.  This map was produced by J.W. Smith and M.S. Green, a 1:2,500,000 scale map (Lawton and Pierce, 1972).
From the beginning of the United States from the American Revolutionary war on Georgia geology was included in the maps produced for the entire country.  The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by W. Maclure.  Several reports used Maclure   s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814; Marcou, 1858).  Within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology Cleaveland (1816) produced a geological map of the U.S.   In 1843 Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S. where Boue produced a geological structure map of the globe.  Marcou (1853) produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America.  Rogers in 1856 created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America.   There was a short description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Hitchcock in 1872, which had a small-scale geological maps included (Hitchcock, 1872).   Hitchcock & Blake (1873) published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond   s Statistics of mines and mining.  In 1874 they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas.  Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873.  Gray   s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1&nbsp;inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 (Hitchcock, 1876).  A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1&nbsp;inch to 105.5 miles by Bradley (1875).  In the 1880s there were a couple geological maps of the U.S. produced McGee (1884) with a description of the map in 1886, and Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1&nbsp;inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological map of the U.S. (1887).  Torbert and McGee produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S. in 1895.  Willis produced a geological map of the U.S. in 1906.  There have been a host of geological maps of the U.S. produced in the 20th century Stose, a 1:2,500,000 scale map (1932), Stose and Smith, a 1:500,000 scale map, (1939), Loebeck, (1941) are just a few that have been produced.  The most recent map being produced is the National Map that is a cooperative project (http://nationalmap.gov/).
More recently geologic mapping has been undertaken by the Georgia Geological Survey through the STATEMAP project.   This project was funded from the .  This federal Act was for the purpose of producing geologic maps that for 2 decades had been    drastically curtailed   .  It was recognized that    geologic maps are the primary data base for virtually all applied and basic earth-science applications    (NGMA, 1992).  This Act provided 50% of the funds needed, whereas each state that wanted to participate supplied the other 50% of the funding to complete these various mapping projects.  Ultimately this project was to be a part of the National Map and the subsequent databases generated by the various state and national mapping projects.  For more information see the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (http://ncgmp.usgs.gov/ncgmpabout/).
