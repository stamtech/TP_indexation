The 35th District is the coastal counterpart to the 33rd. Almost the entire coastline of Orange County is in the 35th.
Like the 33rd, the 35th includes cities in north, central, and south Orange County. However, the 35th has a definite northern center of gravity. Huntington Beach is the largest city in the district, and Fountain Valley, Cypress, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, Los Alamitos, and La Palma are all in the district. In addition, the heavily Vietnamese western portions of Garden Grove and Westminster are in the district.
The remainder of the district is spread between Central and South Orange County and includes all of the cities touching the Pacific Ocean, including Newport Beach, Laguna Hills, Laguna Beach, and Dana Point. Irvine also contributes nearly 150,000 residents to the district. A tiny, heavily Republican piece of Santa Ana near Fountain Valley/Costa Mesa is included.
In 2004, then-Senator John Campbell replaced Chris Cox in California's 48th congressional district when Cox was nominated to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tom Harman was elected in a special election in 2006 with 69% of the vote.
While the 1991 district looked fairly similar to the 2001 district, the shifting boundary between the 35th and 34th Senate Districts revolves around the growing Republicanization of Garden Grove and Westminster. In 1991, only a tiny section of Westminster was in the 35th, but the 2001 district contains most of the city, and most of Little Saigon. To balance population with the 33rd, redistricting removed Tustin, Aliso Viejo, and the Lagunas   except Laguna Beach   and added Dana Point. This change did not have a significant effect on partisanship in the district.
