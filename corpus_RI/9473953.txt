On April 4, 2011, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, formally announced his '''re-election campaign for 2012'''. He is expected to be opposed by a candidate from the Republican PartyShear, Micheal D. (2011-04-04) Adams, Richard (2011-04-04) and candidates from other parties, in an election scheduled for Tuesday, November 6, 2012. If re-elected, Obama would be prohibited by the U.S. Constitution from seeking a third term.
The campaign will be based in Chicago, and key members of Obama's successful 2008 campaign such as David Plouffe and David Axelrod will reportedly return. On the day of the announcement, the campaign released a promotional video showing supporters of Obama organizing for the re-election effort. ''The Guardian'' noted that this was the first U.S. presidential re-election campaign to use Twitter and Facebook for promotion.
After the 2008 presidential election, Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States. During his presidency, Obama signed 2 pieces of economic stimulus - the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 in December 2010. As President, Obama also signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Dodd   Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. Obama signed New START, an arms control treaty with Russia, began to gradually withdraw troops from Iraq, began to increase troops in Afghanistan, and enforced the United Nations-sanctioned no-fly zone over Libya. On May 1, 2011, President Obama announced that a small team of American military forces, acting on his direct order, killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Following the 2010 Midterm Elections there was a lot of speculation about the details of the President's reelection campaign. There were many who speculated that his campaign would raise more than one billion U.S. dollars.
On April 4, 2011, President Obama officially announced his candidacy for a second term. The announcement was done through an online video placed on his website titled "It Begins With Us". The President also filled out official forms with the FEC on April 4.
The campaign will be based in Chicago in One Prudential Plaza. The decision to create the campaign headquarters in Chicago instead of Washington, D.C. is a historic move. No modern incumbent president has based his re-election headquarters in a location outside of Washington. The decision to base the campaign outside of Washington was mainly to build up grassroots support.

The campaign began accepting online donations on April 4, 2011, the day Obama announced his candidacy. In the first 24 hours after online donations began to be accepted, over 10,000 online donations were made. President Obama headlined his first campaign fundraiser in April 2011 in Chicago. He also headlined fundraisers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in April 2011. On April 29, 2011, it was announced that Matthew Barzun, the United States Ambassador to Sweden, would serve as finance chairman. Many sources claim that the campaign may be the first campaign in U.S. history to raise more than one billion dollars. In March 2011, Campaign Chairman Jim Messina asked a group of 450 top donors to raise $350,000. The LGBT community has donated a record amount so far to the campaign.
A June 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll found that in a hypothetical race between President Obama and a generic Republican, 45% backed the generic Republican and 42% backed the President. The advantage Obama holds over an unnamed Republican is similar to the lead that former President George W. Bush held over an unnamed Democrat in 2003 and is larger than the lead former President Bill Clinton held over an unnamed Republican in 1995.
