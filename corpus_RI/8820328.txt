In 1972, Wildwood Convention Hall, a  building, opened with several stores in front.  Located on the Boardwalk at 4522 Ocean Avenue, it was used until the need for a larger convention center and arena were made in 1999.  NJSEA promptly joined in, and broke ground in 2000, tearing a  hole in the boardwalk in the process, opening the new building in 2001, and the following year, razed the old hall, creating the new dramatic entrance way for the facility.
