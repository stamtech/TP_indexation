The '''Santa Ana Winds Youth Band''' is a community youth marching band in Orange County, California. The band's name was derived from the Santa Ana winds weather pattern, and is a reference to the fact that the many performers use wind instruments.
The band was started in 1971 by Robert Ward (d. May 31, 2008) and quickly grew to become a staple group in parades across Southern California.
On October 20, 1971, the Board of Managers of the Santa Ana/Tustin Y.M.C.A. approved the band as an affiliate club. The Winds were appointed as the "Official Ambassadors of Music for Orange County" by the Board of Supervisors of Orange County, and still hold that distinguished title.
The 2007-2008 season is the 36th season of the Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, and it is under the direction of Mr. Greg Rochford.
The Santa Ana Winds have performed in hundreds of events over their 35 years serving the community. They have performed in parades, field shows, and concerts throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The band has marched in the Hollywood Christmas Parade for over twenty-five years. They have appeared in such films as Coneheads, First Daughter, a Sprung Monkey video, and an episode of Boston Public, among other events.
The group is a two-time national field show champion. They recorded a record in London during one of their European tours.
No audition is required. Membership is open to any youth ages 14   21. The band accepts all wind instruments, percussion, flag spinners, baton twirlers, drum majors, and banner carriers. Members come from Orange County, Los Angeles County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and some from San Diego and Ventura County.
