In the introduction to a 2009 interview with ''Forbes.com'', former general manager Nathan Richardson was said to have built "annual revenue from $10 million to $110 million and expanded the site's content partners from 10 to 200. In 2005 ''Institutional Investor'' ranked  the most influential person in online finance." In the interview, Richardson described the process of building the financial-information modules and creating a "moat" around the content (to keep visitors sticking to the site). (Richardson is now at Paidcontent.org, part of the Guardian Media Group.)
