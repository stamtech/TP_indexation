The executive mayor of the municipality is Eleanore Bouw-Spies of the ANC who became mayor in May 2007 after the short-lived DA-led multi-party coalition led by Doris Wakeford-Brown had collapsed following the withdrawal of a local civic party (Knysna Civic Alliance) which has now sided with the ANC. In the September 2007 floor crossing window the two civic party councillors defected to the ANC, giving the party an outright majority of 9 seats out of 16.
Wakeford-Brown became executive mayor in December 2006 after Joy Cole of the ANC resigned to pursue another career. Cole had formed a broad-based coalition of the ANC and DA after the March 2006 local government elections when neither party had obtained an outright majority.
Joy Cole was first elected mayor under the DA in December 2000 but defected in the September 2004 floor-crossing to become an ANC-aligned independent and reconstituted the council under ANC control.
