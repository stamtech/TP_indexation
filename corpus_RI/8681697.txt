The engine range of the new Volvo V60 is the same as the Volvo S60, with 4 petrol engines and three diesels which will come from the new range of engines that Volvo released in 2010 for the 2011 Model Year. The engines available are the T3, T4, T5 and T6 petrol engines and D3, D5 and 1.6D DRIVe diesel engines, the latter of which has Stop Start Technology to increase the efficiency of the engine. If it does come to North America, likely only the T6 would be available.
The Volvo V60 comes with Volvo's City Safety system as standard, which is the same system fitted to its sister the S60 and XC60. This system stops the car in the event of impending collision in 'City Traffic' below . A new safety feature named "Pedestrian Detection", available on both the V60 and S60, detects people in front of the car and automatically applies the brakes if the driver does not react in time.
