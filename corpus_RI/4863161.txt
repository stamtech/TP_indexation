The '''New England Collegiate Conference''' ('''NECC''') has been the name of two incarnations of collegiate athletic conferences.
The NECC was an NCAA Division II college athletic conference based in the Northeastern United States that dissolved during the late 1990s after most of its members either moved to Division I or joined Division II leagues such as the Northeast Ten Conference or the East Coast Conference.
The conference was founded in 1981 as the New England College Basketball League, and eventually expanded to sponsor eleven sports: men's and women's soccer,men's and women's volleyball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's basketball, baseball and softball.  
In June 2007, nine colleges from New England announced the creation of a new athletic conference under the same NECC name. 
The league, which will begin operations July 1, 2008, as a Division III conference includes Bay Path College (Longmeadow, Mass.), Becker College (Leicester, Mass.), Daniel Webster College (Nashua, N.H.), Elms College (Chicopee, Mass.), Lesley University (Cambridge, Mass.), Mitchell College (New London, Conn.), Newbury College (Brookline, Mass.), Southern Vermont College (Bennington, Vt.), and Wheelock College (Boston, Mass.). 
The conference plans to initially sponsor 14 championship sports.
