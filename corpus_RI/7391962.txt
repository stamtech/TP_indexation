Before Bickley-Warren was ever established, founders/producers William Bickley and Michael Warren (who later joined Miller-Boyett) were writers and supervising producers for the Miller-Boyett produced ''Perfect Strangers'', before becoming co-executive producers in the show's 1989-1990 season and executive producers/showrunners from the 1990-91 season until the 1993 series finale. At this time, Bickley and Warren went on to create shows for Miller/Boyett, starting with the ''Perfect Strangers'' spinoff ''Family Matters'' in 1989, which joined its parent show on ABC's ''TGIF'' lineup,  and ''The Family Man'' in 1990, which aired for one season on CBS. Two years into the run of ''Family Matters'', they formed a company that would be known as Bickley-Warren Productions, after they became the show's executive producers.
The company lasted for six years after which Warren joined Miller-Boyett Productions in 1998 (which was renamed Miller-Boyett-Warren Productions that year).
While ''Family Matters'', ''Getting By'' and ''Step by Step'' were produced by the Bickley-Warren and Miller-Boyett production companies jointly, ''Hangin' with Mr. Cooper'' and ''Kirk'' were not produced in association with Miller-Boyett Productions, and ''Perfect Strangers'' was not produced by Bickley-Warren Productions (even though Bickley and Warren executive produced the series for the show's final three seasons, even after the formation of their production company), though all of their series under the Bickley-Warren banner were produced by Lorimar/Warner Bros. Television.
