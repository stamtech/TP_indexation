The '''Dieppe maps''' are a series of world maps produced in Dieppe, France, in the 1540s, 1550s and 1560s. They are large hand-produced maps, commissioned for wealthy and royal patrons, including Henry II of France and Henry VIII of England. The Dieppe school of cartographers included Pierre Desceliers, Johne Rotz, Guillaume Le Testu, Guillaume Brouscon and Nicholas Desliens.
A common feature of most of the Dieppe world maps (see Vallard 1547, Desceliers 1550) are the compass roses and navigational rhumb lines, suggestive of a sea-chart. However, they are best understood as works of art, clearly intended to be spread out on a table, and containing information on the latest discoveries, side by side with mythological references and illustrations. For example, the Desceliers 1550 map carries descriptions of early French attempts to colonise Canada, the conquests of Peru by the Spanish and the Portuguese sea-trade among the Spice Islands. On the same map can be found descriptions of legendary Cathay, king Prester John in Ethiopia, and the race of Amazons in Russia.  Other Dieppe maps also carry fictitious features such as the Marco Polo inspired Zanzibar/Iles des Geanz. (see Vallard 1547, Rotz 1542 and Dauphin c1536-42). As with other maps made before the 17th century, the Dieppe maps show no knowledge of longitude. While latitude could be marked in degrees as observed by astrolabe or quadrant, easting could only be given in distance. Mercator's projection first appeared in 1568-9, a development too late to influence the Dieppe cartographers.
Most of the Dieppe maps depict a large land mass entitled ''Jave la Grande,'' between what is now Indonesia and Antarctica. In the English-speaking world particularly, academic and popular interest in the Dieppe maps over the last 150 years has focused largely on this feature of the maps. This is because Jave la Grande is thought by some writers to provide clues of a possible Portuguese exploration of Australia's coasts in the 1520s. However, the most recent academic writings on the Dieppe maps by Carile(1997), Brunelle (2007) and King (2009) have suggested the maps need to be considered in their entirety, and consideration needs to be given to what they reveal about various influences on the mapmakers, as well as French aspirations. This group of writers argue that the maps are not necessarily literal records of voyages of exploration.
Professor Gayle K. Brunelle of California State University has argued that, although the Dieppe school of cartographers was active for only a generation   from about 1535 to 1562   the cartographers associated with it were acting as propagandists for French geographic knowledge and territorial claims in the New World. The decades when the Dieppe school was flourishing were also the decades in which French trade with the New World was at its 16th century height, in terms of the North Atlantic fish trade, the still fledgling fur trade, and, most important for the cartographers, the rivalry with the Portuguese for control of the coasts of Brazil and the supplies of lucrative Brazilwood. Brunelle says that the Dieppe cartographers accessed cartographic skills and geographic knowledge from Portuguese  mariners, pilots, and geographers working in France, at the same time as they were producing maps meant to emphasize French dominion over the New World, both in Newfoundland and in Brazil, that the Portuguese also claimed. She noted that, in design and decorative style the Dieppe school maps represented a blending of the latest geographical and nautical knowledge circulating in Europe (and the portolan style of depicting coastlines), with older conceptualizations of world geography deriving from Ptolemy and mediaeval cartographers and explorers such as Marco Polo. Renaissance mapmakers such as those based in Dieppe relied heavily on each other's work, as well as on maps from previous generations, and thus their maps represented a mixture of old and new data and even differing conceptualizations of space, often coexisting uneasily in the same map.
The Dieppe maps all depict the southern continent, Terra Australis, incorporating a huge promontory extending northward called "Jave la Grande". According to the French geographer Numa Broc, Terra Australis found its most inspired illustrator in pilot-cartographer of Le Havre, Guillaume Le Testu. Le Testu's ''Cosmographie Universelle'', the sumptuous atlas he presented in 1556 to Coligny, Grand Admiral of France, constituted a veritable encyclopaedia of the geographic and ethnographic knowledge of the time. French historian Frank Lestringant has said: "The nautical fiction of Le Testu fulfilled the conditions of a technical instrumentality, while giving to King Henry II and his minister, Admiral Coligny, the    anticipatory image of an empire that awaited to be brought into being". In the ''Cosmographie'' twelve vividly coloured charts are devoted to a survey of the fictitious continent Terra Australis. In these charts, Le Testu drew the outlines of an enormous Austral continent which covered the southern part of the globe and filled a considerable part of the Indian Ocean. This imaginary land derived from the ''Antichthone'' of the Greeks and had already been reactivated, notably by the mathematician and cosmographer Oronce Fine (1531) and by Le Testu's predecessors of the Dieppe school. According to the Portuguese historian Paolo Carile, the attitude of Le Testu reveals a cultural conflict between the old cosmographic beliefs and the demands of an empirical concept of geographical and ethnographical knowledge, influenced by the rigour of his Calvinist faith. Carile notes that while on the iconographic side Le Testu depicts an Austral Continent with strangely tropical conditions incorporating beasts drawn from fantasy and old legends, on the other side he nullifies these leaps of imagination by his admission that the land shown as part of the Terra Australis was still unknown and what was marked out on his map was based solely on imagination and surmise.
Another indication of this reliance is given by the placement of ''CATIGARA'' (Kattigara) on the western coast of South America on the mid-1540s Harleian mappemonde and on Le Testu   s 1556 map of western South America: the same location it occupied on Fine   s 1531 mappemonde and on Schoener   s 1523 and 1533 globes. ''Kattigara'' (or ''Cattigara'') was understood by the second century Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemy to be a port and emporium on the eastern side of the ''Sinus Magnus,'' or Great Gulf, the actual Gulf of Thailand.  The 1507 Waldseemuller map shows ''Catigara'' in this location.  Following the 1519-1521 circumnavigation of the world by the expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan and completed after his death in the Philippines by Sebastian de Juan Sebastian Elcano, Schoener identified the Pacific Ocean with Ptolemy   s ''Sinus Magnus,'' which he labelled on his 1523 globe, ''SINUS MAGNUS EOV MARE DE SUR'' (the Great Gulf, Eastern Sea, South Sea   ). The eastern side of the Sinus Magnus, which Schoener took to be the peninsula of India Superior (Indochina) where Cattigara was located, was therefore identified by him with South America, which on his 1533 globe bears the inscription, ''America, Indiae superioris et Asiae continentis pars'' (   America, a part of India Superior and of the Asian continent   ). Cattigara was accordingly located on Schoener   s 1523 and 1533 globes on the western coast of South America. ''CATIGARA'' occupied the same location on Fine   s mappemonde, as it also did on the Dieppe school maps, the mid-1540s Harleian mappemonde and Le Testu   s 1556 map of western South America.
The extent of French knowledge concerning Terra Australis in the mid-16th century is indicated by Lancelot Voisin de La Popeliniere, who in 1582 published ''Les Trois Mondes'', a work setting out the history of the discovery of the globe. In ''Les Trois Mondes'', La Popeliniere pursued a geopolitical design by using cosmographic conjectures which were at the time quite credible, to theorize a colonial expansion by France into the Austral territories. His country, eliminated from colonial competition in the New World after a series of checks at the hands of the Portuguese and  Spanish, could only thenceforward orient her expansion toward this "third world". He declared: "to the ambition of the French is promised the Terre Australe, a territory which could not but be filled with all kinds of goods and things of excellence". Taking up an earlier proposal by Andre d'Albaigne and inspired by Le Testu's description of Terra Australis, La Popeliniere described in eloquent terms this unknown "third world" which would complete the Old World and the New World. He wrote; 
It is noteworthy that La Popeliniere believed that only Ferdinand Magellan had actually sighted the southern continent, in the shape of Tierra del Fuego. He was apparently ignorant that Francis Drake sailed through open sea to the south of Tierra del Fuego in 1578, proving it to be an island and not, as Magellan had supposed, part of Terra Australis. La Popeliniere, the would be colonist, gave no indication that he thought that anyone, French, Portuguese or otherwise, had visited the part of Terra Australis shown on the Dieppe maps as "Jave la Grande".
Discussion of the Dieppe maps in contemporary Australia is exclusively confined to the Jave la Grande feature. In the media, the maps are sometimes mistakenly described as Portuguese  and they are often cited as evidence James Cook did not "discover Australia".
Since then a number of other writers have contributed to the debate about the "Jave La Grande" landmass that appears on the Dieppe maps. These include;
