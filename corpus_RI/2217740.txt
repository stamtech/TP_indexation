The '''Kentucky International Convention Center''' (KICC), formerly called the '''Commonwealth Convention Center''', is a large multi-use facility in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It, along with the Kentucky Exposition Center, hosts conventions for the Louisville area. It was built on the site of the Tyler Block and opened in 1977.
While the convention center does not have a permanent arena, it still has hosted various sporting events, including the 2002 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball tournament and the NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship from 1995 to 2000. It also hosted select University of Louisville women's basketball games from the 1989   90 season through 1992   93, and again in the 1994   95, 2000   01, and 2008   09 seasons. One of the exhibit halls was temporarily turned into an arena, with seats for about 7,000.
