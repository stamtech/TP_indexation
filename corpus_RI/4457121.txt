Vogel graduated from Bismarck High School in 1935.  He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of North Dakota in 1939 and his law degree from William Mitchell College of Law (then the Minneapolis-Minnesota College of Law) in 1942.  He was admitted to both the Minnesota and North Dakota Bars. 
He was in private practice in Garrison, North Dakota from 1943 to 1948, at which time he was elected McLean County States Attorney.  In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed him U.S. Attorney for the District of North Dakota, a position he held until 1961.  Afterward, Vogel became a partner in the eponymous firm of Vogel, Bair, and Brown, located in Mandan, North Dakota.  He made an unsuccessful run for Congress the next year as a member of the Democratic/Nonpartisan League.
In 1973, Governor Arthur A. Link appointed Vogel to the North Dakota Supreme Court, and he won a ten-year term in the following year's general election.  Despite his win, Vogel resigned from the supreme court four years later to become a professor at the University of North Dakota School of Law.  He simultaneously opened the Vogel Law Firm in Grand Forks.
Vogel retired in 1997, dying eight years later on January 28, 2005, in Rochester, Minnesota.
