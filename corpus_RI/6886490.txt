The organisation was founded in 2002 as the personal website of French Kemetist Sylvia Etienne, also known as ''Sat-Aset'' (Egyptian, "daughter of Aset").
On 13 May 2003, a Yahoo! group called Ta-Noutri was established, to speak and exchange experiences with other Kemetics in France. This group was the base for the new organisation that created their first forum that November.
In 2004, some motivated new members in the Yahoo group decided to create a website and forum board together. In September 2004, the first version of the Ta Noutri website became active. Less than a year later, Ta Noutri bought its own domain name, where the official website and forum are now hosted. Preparations are underway to be declared an official non-profit organisation.
