The '''2008 United States presidential election in Massachusetts''' took place on November 4, 2008 in Massachusetts as in all 50 states and D.C., as part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Massachusetts was won by Democrat nominee Barack Obama by a 25.8% margin of victory slightly larger than when John Kerry won his home state with a 25.2% margin. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. No Republican presidential nominee has won a single county in the state nor obtained over 40% of the vote since 1988. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama captured the state's 12 electoral votes winning 61.80% of the popular vote to Republican John McCain's 35.99%.

Massachusetts was (and is) the bluest state in the nation, in terms of voting for the Democrat in Presidential elections. Massachusetts is ethnically diverse and less religious. The Bay State has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1960 except for Ronald Reagan's landslide victories of  1980 and 1984. In 1972, only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia voted for Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern as Republican Richard M. Nixon won reelection.
Barack Obama won the state's 12 electoral votes with 61.80% of the vote to John McCain's 35.99%. This is slightly higher than Kerry's victory in 2004. Despite that, four counties in the state trended away from the Democratic party: Bristol, Plymouth, Norfolk, and Worcester.
Both of Massachusetts's U.S. Senators and all 10 of its U.S. Representatives were Democrats, and Democrats heldsupermajorities in the Massachusetts Legislature. At the same time in 2008, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry was reelected with 65.86% of the vote over Republican Jim Beatty's 30.93% as were all of the state's delegates in the U.S. House of Representatives. At the state level, Democrats picked up three seats in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and one seat in the Massachusetts Senate.
Barack Obama swept all 10 congressional districts in Massachusetts.
Technically the voters of Massachusetts cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Massachusetts is allocated 12 electors because it has 10 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 12 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 12 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 12 were pledged to Obama and Biden:
