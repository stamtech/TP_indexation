 "I Got a Crush... on Obama" was also nominated for a YouTube Award, and has been viewed over 20 million times on YouTube. In addition to the Obama Girl Video, BarelyPolitical has produced several other political themed videos.
In October 2007 Barely Political was bought by Next New Networks, for an unknown amount, which in turn was acquired by YouTube in spring 2011. Herb Scannell, co-founder and CEO of Next New Networks, stated, "With BarelyPolitical, we've added a team that can grow our reach to a very important audience &mdash; one that likes their politics with a healthy serving of humor &mdash; timed perfectly with the upcoming 2008 election season."
When asked about the video by the ''Des Moines Register'' on June 18, 2007, Obama said, "It's just one more example of the fertile imagination of the Internet. More stuff like this will be popping up all the time." Obama told the Associated Press that the Obama Girl video had upset his daughters and said, "You do wish people would think about what impact their actions have on kids and families."
