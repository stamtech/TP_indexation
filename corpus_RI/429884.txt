The San Diego Convention Center Corporation (SDCCC) is a non-profit public benefit corporation created by the City of San Diego to manage and market the San Diego Convention Center. A nine-member board of directors composed of business and community leaders establishes policy for the SDCCC.
The Convention Center opened in November 1989 and an expansion, which doubled the size of the original building, opened in September 2001. In 1993 the city of San Diego transferred management of the San Diego Concourse, a mid-sized meeting facility that originally opened in 1964 and the San Diego Civic Theatre to the SDCCC. The Civic Theatre is now managed by San Diego Theatres Inc., a non-profit subsidiary of the SDCCC and responsibility for the Concourse was transferred back to the City of San Diego in July 2005.
The San Diego Convention Center Corporation's mission is to "generate significant regional economic benefits by attracting national conventions and trade shows to our world-class facility."
