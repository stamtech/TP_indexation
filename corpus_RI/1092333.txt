Later, it was held at the Foothill College campus in Los Altos Hills, and it then moved to the Santa Clara Convention Center.  In 2004, FanimeCon was held in the San Jose Convention Center over Memorial Day weekend where it generated more than $5M in local economic impact. The convention continues to be held annually at that location.
FanimeCon features events including artist's alley, a masquerade ("Der Cosplay"), AMV contest, swap meet, game show, karaoke, video gaming, tabletop gaming, dances, and musical performances. Big attractions include celebrity guests, such as Hiroyuki Yamaga, the Japanese writer-director-producer famous for the film ''The Wings of Honneamise''. There are also panels scheduled on a wide range of topics including anime blogs, pocky, and how to make shoes and boots for costumes. FanimeCon also includes round-the-clock video programming.
FanimeCon was first held on June 19, 1994 at California State University, Hayward in Hayward, California as a free anime convention. FanimeCon stayed at California State University until 1996 when the convention moved to Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. Anime Resource Group (ARG) was formed the same year as the parent organization. 1996 was also the first year the convention became a paid event.
Hiroyuki Yamaga became FanimeCon's first Japanese guest of honor in 1997. The programming expanded to include an art show, a cosplay show, an anime game show, and live music. In 1998 FanimeCon expanded to two days and became a three day convention the following year. FanimeCon moved to the Santa Clara Convention Center in 2000 where it stayed for four years before moving to the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in 2004.
