The problem was that there was an image still in the SVG. An image, probably used to trace from, was left in the SVG, but not embedded, simply a link to a file. Because this file was obviously not on Wikimedia's servers, it threw up an error and so it wouldn't display. I simply removed the image in a text editor and it displayed fine.

1. A background map of the United States (with state borders), Southern Canada and Northern Mexico, just like this map shows.
2. The 3 storm tracks with similar paths as shown.  The paths can end as arrows where they do on the map now.
3. The "Warm Moist" and "Cool Dry" air mass identifiers should be similarly placed as well.
4. Then in addition what would be nice is some kind of simple legend on the bottom, maybe with a line color and the name of the storm track next to it. 
That's about it.  As far as sources for the map, do I need to provide that, or is there a repository somewhere?     ( ) 03:46, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

This is somewhat of an improvement.     01:34, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
The last flag was done by inkscape tracing the seal to svg format.  It's as good as I'm going to get it by that method.  Redrawing it by hand would be a lot of work, and really should have a better image to start with.      03:00, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
The flag had a thin blue line at the top for a while.  Very thin; I did not notice at for a while, then fixed it.  Not sure why it happened. A stroke effect in Inkscape which I either added unknowningly or Inkscape sometimes seems to do weird things.  For the Seal, the svg may not be an improvement over the png.    19:45, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
FYI you can download an svg by using "save page as" and then upload them wherever you wish.     19:45, 5 January 2008 (UTC)
Sorry, but I feel that the old PNG version is more true to the actual look of the image. The SVG version that has been created here is very green and doesn't look right to my eyes. Not only that but the coat of arms are very blurred and it is hard to make the image out. Sadly I lack the knowledge of how to improve the images but is there any way we could make corrections and possibly enlarge the image?   ( ) 18:54, 10 January 2008 (UTC)

Ok, Please note that Jeff's pattern for Seshat didn't really work.  Adding spots, we're up to 1.35MB, which if it isn't a record for an image this size, it's at least notable.  The spots are evenly spaced on the image, even if they don't show up that way on some sizes of images in the screen.

Ok, here's the big map.  It needs a good proof reading.  I put up two versions, a .svg and a .png.  Often the Firefox browser displays svg's oddly, with the text too big, and it did it here.  (Anybody out there with a solution or even just an explanation would be most welcome.)   When it's been checked over, I'll do the two  smaller versions in both file types.       02:44, 22 January 2008 (UTC)
Look over one version of each the new ones carefully. (the PNG's are probably easier) I moved some street labels around, and could have deleted or submerged something.  The SVG with both campuses is the one to be sure to hang on to; it is the master from which the others are made.  The other SVG are are complete, but do have some labels moved.  
SVG vs PNG  As far as I know there is a indeed a move to svg.  But at this time Internet Explorer does not read them at all and Firefox doesn't always do it well.  (doesn't do the street labels at all well on these.)  So, while you may want to use the png's today, the day of the svg will come.  You might want have an admin rename the map of the entire campus.  (I used main streets meaning main streets labeled - saved in the event of an Inkscape crash) The labeling did not turn out to be as bad a chore as I thought it might.  Enjoy!      02:56, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

The only real difference I see is the use of thick outlines on the "quality png" one.  I've never been a fan of outlines on coats of arms, because if they're designed right, the colors that border one another contrast with each other.  That's clearly the case here.  The white horse and rider contrast with the red, so there's no need for a thick black outline.

Hey all, I was not aware of this going on when I uploaded the two I extracted.  I've had them done for little while but had not gotten around to uploading them... may have saved a little work, sorry about that.  Great job all around though; it'll be nice to have some SVG versions of these.  One thing is that the Senate and Congress unofficial seals (and the official Senate one) seem to use a different font than the one used here... not sure if that can be changed or not, but it may help if it could.  Some elements of the VP seal are more gray in the source image; that may look better against the white background.  A couple of other notes -- the House "seal" here is also unofficial, as is the Congress one.  There is no official seal of Congress, and the official House seal apparently apparently dates from 1963 and shows the southeast (House) side of the U.S. Capitol building with a ring of stars around it, but I've never seen an image of it.  Earlier house seals apparently showed the Capitol building as it was in the very early 1800s (before even the original dome was built).  The senate seal is only used in very particular circumstances, so it seems they have come up with these "unofficial", alternate versions.  As you see, one of them always seems to be used on podiums during speeches, etc.  The image of the official seal is from a stained glass window in the Capitol (see  ).  I guess the House seal is under similar restrictions, so they have a similar set of unofficial versions used on websites etc., but I've not seen a picture of any of the official ones.  The stars on the shield probably come from the vector of the Great Seal (see the original PDF source; they have the stars even though the Great Seal is not supposed to have them).  Anyways, kudos again on the great job here -- it's great to have SVG versions of a lot of these.  And good luck on the reverse of the Great Seal -- I've never found a vector version of it  :-)    ( ) 17:07, 19 January 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure about Stanford's vector generator: it seems to produce rough edged letters, unlike, say the already uploaded House seal. I think that Stanford may be useful for a start, but things like lettering may be better done by insertion of text manually.   ( ) 21:15, 22 January 2008 (UTC)
I think they're all done (?), and the back of the Great Seal can wait untill we find a PDF with a vector version of it, or failing that someone lists it here again after a few months.   ( ) 20:09, 23 January 2008 (UTC)
This is probably easily the most productive request I've ever seen here, I'll have to give you all a  , so you can all take a petal and leave the center for the lab itself ;D.   ( ) 17:35, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

Isn't a jpg the most suitable format for a photo? Wont PNG be too large? I would have done it already, but you didn't specify a suitable name (and I still wonder why you can do these yourself). ----  ''' ''' 17:12, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
Sagredo, thanks for understanding, I don't think I'm the most important guy, you guys are doing all the heavy lifting, I just keep you stocked. :) The image is great, cute name, much more concise ;), marking as done! Thanks!   ( ) 04:51, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

Wow, Adobe really did a number on that text.  Placing each letter individually, and badly.  Anyway, I fixed the text up, but I still want to do a bit of redrawing. --  ( ) 08:08, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
I have now re-drawn the picture from scratch in inkscape.  I'm also not a real graphic artist, so it's not picture perfect, but let me know what you think --  ( ) 10:09, 20 December 2007 (UTC)
OK, I made the arrows thicker, and added arrows pointing to the options, but I am slightly doubtful about that: Does the cell start out by presenting the foreign protein, and then have its MHC I downregulated, or does the pathogen downregulate the MHC I from the start, so that the antigen is never presented in the first place? --  ( ) 00:57, 24 December 2007 (UTC)
OK, done. --  ( ) 08:59, 8 January 2008 (UTC)

Right, first of all the reason it wasn't showing up at all in wikipedia is that you left the image that you traced from in there, because MediaWiki couldn't find the image, it left an error so that's why altogether it wouldn't show. After you got rid of the image, the next reason it wouldn't show was because the fill of the graph, although was black, was transparent, so you saw right through it ( :-) ). I appreciate you are trying to help by creating SVG, my first SVG was a disaster, but now I am much better. 
I can see you have created the image in excel and traced it in inkscape. However, tracing an image like this is very ineffecient, creating a high filesize which is not so useful. You can also tell it has been traced by lkie on the text, the borders of it are not straight. A better way to do it is

Here is this one, let me know if you would like a different projection, or different colours, or numbers, words etc.:   Also if you have any other maps you need in SVG and there is a shapefile available, don't hesitate to ask, because it only takes a minute.    ( ) 00:30, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
