 Its low-floor variant, the '''Volvo B6LE''', was first built in 1994. 
The Volvo B6/B6LE chassis was built to compete with the Dennis Dart/Dart SLF chassis. It could be fitted with Volvo TD63E/TD63ES engine (later Volvo D6A engine). The Volvo B6 prototypes were built in Austria, but the production buses were built in the United Kingdom.
The B6 was mainly built for the UK market, but some have been exported to Hong Kong and Australia.
The Volvo B6/B6LE was replaced by Volvo B6BLE.
