After Debbie becomes fed up with Steve's immaturity, she meets Etan Cohen, Snot's bar mitzvah study buddy.  To Steve's dismay, Debbie agrees to be Etan's date for his upcoming bar mitzvah.  Worse, Etan invites everyone in school ''except'' Steve to the party.
Deciding to get even, Steve concocts an elaborate plot (a parody of ''Ocean's Eleven'' and ''Ocean's Twelve''), where Barry, Toshi and Roger help him steal all of Etan's bar mitzvah money.  They use an unsuspecting Snot to smuggle the money out of the party, which almost works, except that Snot returns at the last minute and Etan discovers the money on him.
Etan takes Snot to beth din, a Hebrew court where if Snot is found guilty, he will be banned from all Hebrew temples and thus be unable to have a bar mitzvah of his own.  Meanwhile, Debbie dumps Steve for Etan, complicating things for the latter as he wrestles between having his girlfriend back and clearing his best friend's name.  Roger offers to be Snot's lawyer but only manages to ruin the case.  Just as the court is about to rule against Snot, Steve confesses, after which Debbie immediately dumps him.  Snot threatens to end his friendship with Steve, but Steve pleads with Snot, saying, "I lost my ''girl''friend... I can't lose my ''best'' friend!"
Steve sells all of his toys to give Snot a ''Star Trek'' themed bar mitzvah, easily reaffirming their friendship. The episode ends with Roger evidently beginning a heist of Snot's bar mitzvah as Snot's long-lost uncle, only to end up in a confusing situation with him being in two places at once.
In a subplot, Stan loses his cell phone at the movies and it is on vibrate. Francine suggests that he give the cell phone company a plan to use a code that activates the ringer. However, they are unable to locate the company.
