Gowen was born in Florida, and grew up in Kiowa, Oklahoma. (Her first name was inspired by the fact that she was born during a powerful storm.) She won Miss Teen McAlester, Oklahoma, at age 15, and as a teenager moved to Corsicana, Texas. She was a member of the varsity basketball team and placed seventh in state high jump.
Gowen was introduced to poker by her boyfriend's father, and started playing while living in Dallas, driving to Shreveport, Louisiana, on the weekends. She earned national recognition when she followed up her Top 10 finish at the World Poker Tour (WPT) Costa Rica Classic with a win at the WPT Ladies' Night event in 2003, then the highest rated WPT show ever broadcast.
She has served as a guest commentator for the Ultimate Poker Challenge, The Gaming Club World Poker Championship and the 888.com Women's Poker UK Open. She is a regular columnist for ''All In'' magazine. She frequently hosts tournaments and charity events and is now a partner in a poker school. She appeared on the NBC television program ''Poker After Dark'', winning first place (and $120,000) during "Ladies Week" (Week 10) and again during Week 17. She is one of only five players to win three or more Poker After Dark titles.
Gowen was formerly a member of "Team Full Tilt" at online poker site Full Tilt Poker.  In November 2008 she filed suit in Nevada court against Tiltware LLC, the software company associated with Full Tilt, asserting breach of contract among other things.  She seeks damages of $40 million.  The suit was dismissed by a trial court, but later partly reinstated on appeal.
As of 2010, her total live tournament winnings exceed $1,600,000.
