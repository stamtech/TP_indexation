Following up on a phenomenon noted in a number of sources, an enterprising blogger has run an analysis to see where Wikipedia articles appear in different search engines. Confirming what others had observed, he reported that two of three major search engines would show a Wikipedia article in the top 10 search results more than 75% of the time.
The  was conducted by  , a former Slovenian Wikipedian, as part of a university seminar dealing with internet search. Cuhalev used Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, the three largest search engines by market share, which collectively support 80% or more of all internet searches. He reported that Wikipedia appeared in the top 10, thus putting it on the first page of results, on 81% of searches using Google and 77% for Yahoo. MSN produced Wikipedia articles much less often by comparison, only 38% of the time in the first ten results. (Seth Finkelstein argued that the difference was because Yahoo had largely imitated the factors Google uses in weighting pages for search results, while MSN took a different approach.)
Tim Bray,  the difficulty of finding population figures for Canadian provinces, decided that the lack of standardization among more authoritative sources is a major reason people turn to Wikipedia as an "easy and quick" alternative. Bray concluded, "So Wikipedia is going to win. Do you see any other plausible outcome?" One possibility that might bridge the gap, and a reason why dealing with expertise and   among editors are such hot-button topics, would be for the experts to take a greater interest in ensuring Wikipedia's accuracy and quality. The ''Nature'' analysis that compared Wikipedia with the Encyclopaedia Britannica last year (''see  ''), for example, took exactly this approach in urging its readers to improve Wikipedia articles in their fields of study.
