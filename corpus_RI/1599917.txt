In 2005-2006 it formally merged and pooled resources with the other two public secondary schools in Wodonga, Wodonga West Secondary College and Mitchell Secondary College. As of 2006, the former Wodonga High School facility is a specialist senior school for Years 10, 11 and 12, known as Wodonga Senior Secondary College, loosely associated with Wodonga Middle Years College.
The school's motto was "Labora ut Servias' which roughly translates to "Work to Serve."
Wodonga High School's website was http://www.wodonga.vic.edu.au, but this address has been converted to serve Wodonga Senior Secondary College.
