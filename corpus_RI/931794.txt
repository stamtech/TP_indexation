To date, Venice has found their biggest success in The Netherlands. In 2003, the band won an Edison Award (the Dutch version of the Grammy) for Best International Artist, beating out superstars U2 and Coldplay. In that country, Venice's singles are a mainstay on radio, their tours sell out consistently, and they've been guests on countless television programs, most notably Two Meter Sessies, a popular prime-time program that has devoted three entire half-hour episodes to the band; the "Venice - 2 Meter Sessies" CD has gone gold.
The backing vocal duties on Roger Waters 2010 and 2011 tour ''The Wall Live'' are being carried out by Venice's Kipp, Mark and Pat Lennon (who replaced Michael following vocal difficulties exhibited during pre-tour rehearsals).
