Mitchell was a civic leader and civil rights activist in Richmond, Virginia   s Jackson Ward community, a neighborhood of free African Americans and freed slaves which became known as the    Black Wall Street of America.   
He was a long-time editor of the ''Richmond Planet'', an African American newspaper. "it was under his tenure that the Planet gained its well-deserved reputation as a proponent of racial equality and of rights for the African-American community." 
Resulting from his fearless reportage and campaign against racist lynching,  Mitchell himself was threatened with hanging at the hands of a Charlotte County mob angered by his reporting of the lynching, there, of Richard Walker in May 1886. Mitchell was sent a rope with a note attached warning him that he would be lynched himself if he ever set foot in the county. In reply, and borrowing a line from Shakespeare, Mitchell had this to say :    There are no terrors, Cassius, in your threats, for I am so strong in honesty that they pass by me like the idle wind, which I respect not.    Then, armed with two Smith and Wesson pistols, he boarded a train for Smithville, and undeterred, walked the five miles from the station to the site of the hanging. 
Mitchell was also the founder and president of the Mechanics Savings Bank. In 1921, Mitchell ran unsuccessfully to become Governor of Virginia. He is the subject of an extensive exhibit at the Library of Virginia.
In 1904, Mitchell organized a boycott of Richmond   s segregated trolleys which resulted in penalties to white passengers and sent the streetcar company into receivership when it persisted with its Jim Crow policy. 
He is buried in an unmarked grave in Richmond   s Evergreen Cemetery.
