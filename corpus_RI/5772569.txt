The phone has a unique double sliding design with a built in Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The phone is also sold with the "PlayStation Portable" brand logohttp://technabob.com/blog/2007/05/17/anycall-5200-gaming-slider-phone/, though cell phones from the manufacturer do not have the ability to play PSP games. There is a recent update of the firmware which allows you to play PSP games.
The Anycall 5200 can usually be purchased through internet-based merchants such as eBay and is not found in retail stores due to the phone's disregard for copyright restrictions.
It is currently unknown which operating system this phone uses. The merchants claim a "Windows inspired" operating system. However , the cell phone is not any version of windows mobile.
There are multiple issues with this model of phone. One issue is a lack of support from the manufacturers e.g. a lack of replacement accessories and manuals. Other problems include Bluetooth functionality not being present in some versions of the phone and deceptive advertising.
Despite the noted problems the phone has proven popular, with the built in NES functionality as a drawcard.
