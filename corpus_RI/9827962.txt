The Yahoo! '''Style Guide''' covers the basics of writing for the World Wide Web and digital media. It is available in print and digital editions.
The style guide evolved from the company's in-house style sheet for content creation. Initially the style sheet used had its foundation in guides for print, as Yahoo! developed, writers and editors were    cobbling together their own site guidelines as they went along.   
The style guide is intended to be used by all content creators including bloggers, editors, video producers, reporters, technical writers, marketing professionals, user-experience designers and documentation specialists.   
The guide's sections are:    Write for the web   ,    Speak to your entire audience   ,    Write UI text, email, and mobile-friendly content   ,    Manage the mechanics   ,    Clean up your copy   , and    Resources   .
