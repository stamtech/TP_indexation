The '''Peugeot 604''' is an executive car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot from 1975 to 1985. 153,252 examples of the 604 were sold during its 10-year production life. It was made in France and also by Kia in Korea .
The Pininfarina-designed 604 was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1975 and drew praise for its formal, handsome  Pininfarina styling. Sales began in September of that year. Based on the chassis of the Peugeot 504, using its doors, and mostly powered by the then-new  2.7 V6 PRV engine, developed in conjunction with Renault and Volvo, the car was Peugeot's first entry into the large luxury sedan market for 40 years (the last being the short-lived Peugeot 601 of 1934).
The 604 was effectively Peugeot's first entry into the executive class market segment. This meant that the car had to steal customers from marginally more established brands - usually by being remarkable in some tangible respect. The 604 had several noteworthy attributes, namely its beautifully damped and supple ride, equal to a contempary Jaguar XJ6. Additionally the chassis and monocque body, by now a well proven and sturdy design, borrowed from the 504, was immensely strong with a remarkably high torsional rigidity. Peugeot is said  to have made the 604 with "The Engineering of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, The handling of a BMW 5-Series and the elegance of a Jaguar XJ." Price at launch was US$10,990. The 604 had unusually wide opening doors which made entry and egress very easy for users. This was especially appropriate for the car in its role as a limousine.
The 604 was a considered a commercial failure.The production totalled 155,000 units compared to the similarly priced Rover 3500 whos production total was approximately double 'the 604s'. However Peugeot actually made a profit on each car made, primarily because of the shared tooling and engineering with the 504. Contemporary journalists attributed this relative failure to a variety of reasons, such as the unambitious styling, the lack of technical innovation, modest performance, and a reputation for problems with rust.  Others pointed out that the recent energy crisis made this an inauspicious time for Peugeot (along with Renault, whose own six cylinder saloon went on sale a few months earlier) to be moving into the market for six cylinder saloons.   However, by the time the oil shock hit the western economies Peugeot, along with joint venture partners Renault and Volvo, presumably believed they had invested too much in the design and development of production facilities for the new shared engine that would power the 604, to abandon the venture.
During the late 1970s, Peugeot and stablemate Citroen provided two ways to address the executive car segment - understated and classical (604), or distinctive and avant-garde design (CX).
PSA Peugeot Citroen then decided to create a whole new brand, the Talbot out of the Chrysler Europe assets, and introduce a direct competitor to the 604 and CX, the 1980 Talbot Tagora. Both the car and the brand were viewed as a sales and financial disaster, with the Tagora selling only 20% of the units achieved by the 604 and 2% of CX sales.
The German manufacturers did not hesitate to exploit this confusion in France, with cars like the 1974 BMW 5-Series (which also entered a segment new for the manufacturer) that had relatively good build quality. German cars created an unassailable position in the executive class auto market during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Germans were not challenged again until Japan addressed this segment 15 years later.
France has had not much success internationally in the executive segment after the Citroen DS's successor, the Citroen CX. The 604-era was perhaps the last point at which PSA Peugeot Citroen could theoretically have focused resources on becoming a viable long term competitor in this lucrative market segment. This is similar to the situation encountered in the US by the Lincoln Town Car.
The 604 was introduced during the recession caused by the 1973 energy crisis, which created a marketplace that was even more unfriendly to large-engined cars in France.  Peugeot did launch some detuned economy versions of the 604, but they did not increase the car's overall sales.
The 604 did get its name into the history books in 1978 as the first production turbodiesel car, using the 2304&nbsp;cc '''Indenor Diesel''' engine with a turbo fitted - designation XD2S. This was a reliable engine, overshadowed by one major problem. Like many diesel engines of the time they were hard to start in the cold weather, the 604 was one of the worst with this problem, it was a very difficult car to start and some ensured it was parked on a hill to avoid this problem. However despite this problem it was merely an issue of some minor tweaks to the glow plugs and compression that solved this problem and made the car easier to start.
Sales, which were never particularly strong, dipped further in 1980 following the launch of the 505, and the last 604 rolled off the production line in 1985. Peugeot's next major executive car, the 605, was launched in 1989.
Today the 604 is a rare automobile in United Kingdom - Practical Classics estimates there are 15 remaining in the UK as of August 2009.
