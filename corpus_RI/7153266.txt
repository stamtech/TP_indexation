The '''PG line''' is a design feature on the C pillar of the Volvo 700 Series. It is named after Pehr G. Gyllenhammar (nicknamed PG), the then chairman and CEO of Volvo. When designing the Volvo 700 series the engineers had two choices, either to make the roof and side section out of a single sheet of metal or use two separate sheets. The latter was cheaper, but required a weld that needed covering up. The decision was bumped up until it ultimately was taken by Gyllenhammar himself.
