Another great fire occurred within the county in 1916. This fire was in Gordonsville, which was the hub of the county at that time. A volunteer fire company was begun in Gordonsville following the fire.
On January 24, 1921 a group of citizens met to begin the formation of the Orange Volunteer Fire Company. Led by A.J. Harlow, the Mayor of Orange, a campaign was initiated to obtain funds for purchasing more fire fighting equipment. Also, E.H. Rouse was appointed the first Fire Chief of the company. Dr. Rouse, as he was called, was a pharmacist in town and often parked the company   s only motor driven Pumper at his store. A small firehouse was constructed behind the Orange Courthouse from donated labor and donated materials. The company operated out of this building until 1939 when it sold the building to Orange County for office space for $4,000.
Under Dr. Rouse uniforms consisting of white shirts, pants, and hats with red chest sashes were created. Dr. Rouse organized athletic teams and served as the coach. He also oversaw the competition teams for the Virginia State Fire Convention. The earliest record of the Orange team winning an event was reel team in 1925. Dr. Rouse organized a marching band in the 1930s. Many of the O.V.F.C. members had never played a musical instrument, but within 1 year they were giving musical concerts and marching in parades. The base drum from the original band is still located at O.V.F.C.
In 1938, the company moved to the corner of Belleview Avenue and Main Street into a new building which cost $32,000. This building was three stories tall, had 18 rooms, a large banquet room including a full kitchen, and a truck room that fronted Main Street. At the time of the move, the company had three units: a salvage truck, a Pumper, and a ladder truck. An addition was made to this building in the early 1960s to allow parking of the newer, larger fire apparatus. The company remained at this location until 1984.
In 1984, the current Orange Volunteer Fire Company building was completed. At a cost of $550,000, the building was built for the future. It has four drive-through bays, meeting rooms, offices, recreation room, and equipment rooms. The building is located on the company   s fairgrounds near the intersection of Caroline Street and Route 20.
