Arieh finished 3rd in the 2004 World Series of Poker (WSOP) main event and has a World Series of Poker title in Limit Texas hold 'em in 1999 and a 2nd place finish at the 2000 World Series of Poker Pot Limit Omaha event to Johnny Chan. At the 2005 World Series of Poker, he earned his second bracelet by defeating Chris Ferguson in a Pot Limit Omaha event.  He has numerous other tournament victories and final table television appearances. Arieh has played for over 12 years in the Atlanta area and has garnered a reputation as a tough high limit player.
Arieh is something of a divisive figure, such as often relying on verbal bullying when trying to force a hand.  He has earned the friendship and respect of many of his competitors, but has also committed several faux pas during his career, lambasting Harry Demetriou after an important hand in the Main Event of the 2004 World Series of Poker and, after being eliminated from that tournament, pulling one of the remaining players (David Williams) aside and whispering, "bust this motherfucker," referring to the other remaining opponent, eventual champion Greg Raymer . He subsequently apologized after both incidents.  In July 2008, he started playing online at Full Tilt Poker.
In addition to poker, Josh Arieh is also good friends with former professional baseball player John Smoltz.  Josh was Smoltz's caddy when Smoltz attempted to qualify for the US Open Championship in 2010.
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $5,700,000. Most of his tournament winnings ($3,436,897) have come at the WSOP.
