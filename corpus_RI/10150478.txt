He appeared in ten games for the Patriots. He suffered a hamstring pull in July 1995,("Legette has done more watching than playing since he pulled the hamstring in his right leg shortly afterthe Pats began their two-a-day workouts at Bryant College last month.  The injury has left Legette in a Catch-22 situation, unable to impress his coaches at practice yet also unable to get the rest he needs for the muscle to heal.") and was cut by the Patriots in late August 1995, shortly before the start of the 1995 NFL season.
