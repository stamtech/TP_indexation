The '''Alexander Dash''' is a midibus body built by Walter Alexander Coachbuilders of Scotland during the 1990s. It was one of the variants of Alexander's AM-type body and was usually combined with the Dennis Dart and Volvo B6 step-entrance bus chassis.
The body was mainly built for the UK bus market, although one example with a Volvo B6 chassis and air-conditioning was shipped to Hong Kong as a demonstrator. This bus was later acquired by Citybus.
It was superseded by the low-floor Alexander ALX200 model.
