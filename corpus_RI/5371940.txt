The '''old Orange County Courthouse''', located in Orlando, Florida, United States, serves as the home of the Historical Society of Central Florida and the Orange County Regional History Center.  Constructed in 1927, the Courthouse stands in the vicinity of a number of previous judicial buildings. An earlier courthouse was built in 1892 and demolished in 1957. A Courthouse Annex was also constructed in 1960.
The notorious serial killer Ted Bundy was tried for the murder of Kimberly Leach at the Orange County Courthouse beginning on January 7, 1980. Defense attorneys Julius Africano and Lynn Thompson attempted a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but on February 7 the verdict of "Guilty" was issued.
Ted Bundy while being tried for murder engraved his name on the corner of the table at which he was sitting.
