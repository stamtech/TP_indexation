GOES 15 was launched atop a Delta IV-M+(4,2) rocket flying from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 23:57 GMT on 4 March, forty minutes into a sixty-minute launch window. Upon reaching geostationary orbit on 16 March, it was redesignated GOES 15. It is currently undergoing a series of post-launch tests before being placed into storage as a backup to await the failure of an operational GOES satellite.
At launch, the mass of the satellite will be . It has a design life of ten years. Power will be supplied by a single gallium arsenide solar panel, which is intended to provide up to 2.3 kilowatts of power. A 24 cell nickel hydrogen battery will be used to provide power when the satellite is not in sunlight. Instruments aboard GOES15  include a five channel multispectral imager to capture visible light and infrared images of the continental United States, a sounder to take readings of atmospheric temperature and moisture, a solar x-ray imager to detect solar flares, and instruments to monitor the magnetosphere, cosmic background radiation and charged particles.
