The complex interchange between NY 8, NY 12, NY 5, I-790 and NY 49 () in Utica. A diagram of it would be a great feature for all five articles - especially NY 12, where I found it somewhat difficult to describe the movements in words. --    -   07:31, 29 February 2008 (UTC)

More of advice-seeking than an actual request, especially since NE2 indicated above he'd be willing to make new maps for Washington.  The   for this article is low quality, and grossly inaccurate.  (The route isn't perfectly east-west, and does not extend east of I-5.)  While I wait for a new map, is this a case of no map is better than a bad map?  In addition to removing it from the article, it's uploaded to Wikipedia instead of Commons, so I could send it to IFD on low quality/unencyclopedic grounds.
I should also point out that there's no great rush for this particular article to have a map, since it's currently a stub, and may be stuck there for a bit while I work on more pressing matters. -- '''   ''' 09:59, 15 March 2008 (UTC)
I need a map for I-80 (UT) and I-84 (UT), just like the ones on I-70 (UT) and I-15 (UT). Thanks   ( ) 04:33, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
A recently expanded route that could use a map, especially to clarify the expansion.   ( ) 16:39, 24 March 2008 (UTC)
The current map is inaccurate; it appears to show SR 509's routing prior to 1992.  It should follow Marine View Drive instead of 11th Street near its southern terminus , and should be concurrent with SR 99 and SR 516 between Midway and Des Moines. -- '''   ''' 00:21, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
Done. I'll start making more in a bit, after this is confirmed to be good. --  02:56, 17 March 2008 (UTC)
What do you think now? I think if the red line's any thinner it doesn't stand out enough. --  00:15, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
I'll create a few more soon (SR 20 for a cross-state route and a ferry, SR 109 for an unconstructed portion) and then give it a day or so to make sure there are no problems. --  05:34, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
How do tho SR 20 and SR 109 maps look? --  06:41, 18 March 2008 (UTC)
The following are currently nominated for GA and do not have a map.
I have listed them in the order they have been nominated at GA.  I have no preference to how they should look, just use the standard that these states have used in the past.  Thanks.  --'''   ''' 15:37, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
A map of the entire state with 21 highlighted would be great. Thanks!     00:18, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
As it would be impractical to make an exit list or major intersections guide. I think a map would be the best next step to improve this article. Plus I think it would be a cool map too =-). There is a chance for confusion, in that 3 governmental agencies are involved in this byway. All 3 have errors in their maps for a the part of the byway that is outside their jurisdiction:

An article that has been improved to B-class, a map would be appreciated. If possible, a map without shields would be preferred. Thanks -   ( ) 17:11, 12 April 2008 (UTC)
Not a particularly high priority, but was recently upgraded to B-class and could use a map... Personal preference would be ''with'' shields, which seems to be more or less the norm for NJ maps. -- '''   ''' 11:42, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

US 163 needs an updated map.  It offically extends all the way up to I-70 with a concurrency with US 191.  Also, the old map also only shows Interstates, the new one should show some US Routes as well, with shields as well.  Thanks.  --'''   ''' 15:02, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

The following are marked as GA-Class or higher and as needing a map:
I checked the guidelines for B-class, and it appears my edits have bumped up SR-154 to be up to snuff. It's a major expressway through the county so it could use a map. Thanks -   ( ) 01:16, 14 April 2008 (UTC)
