The '''Orange County International Latino Film Festival''' is the operating name used by organizers of the original '''Orange County Latino Film Festival'''. It is based on the OCLFF, and its history is that of the OCLFF.
The first '''Orange County Latino Film Festival''' was held in Historic Downtown Santa Ana's Teatro Fiesta in late 2004. Another festival was again held there in 2005 and experienced a larger turnout than the inaugural year. The festival has since been on hiatus due to a period of reestablishment and restructuring.
As attractions, the organizers managed to bring some name talent including actors and actresses and industry professionals such as Maya Zapata, Michael Pena, Arturo Montiel, Eduardo Santamarina, Moctezuma Esparza, Leopoldo Laborde, Gerardo Tort, and Luis Kelly.
The first organizers of the OCLFF were Manuel Saldivar, a protege of Moctezuma Esparza, Freyr Thor, Olga Plateado and Armando CossyLeon.
