The '''1979 Perth State of Origin Carnival''' was the 20th Australian National Football Carnival, an Australian rules football competition. It was the first carnival to take place under the State of Origin format.
All of the Section One finals were played on Subiaco Oval, in October.
The ACT, coached by Kevin Delmenico, had only two players with VFL experience in their team -  captain Kevin Neale and Fitzroy's Michael Conlan. Their only match was against Warren Roper's Queensland, who had failed to qualify for Section One. The Canberrans themselves had qualified for the Section Two Final by winning a play-off against the Australian Amateurs, New South Wales and Northern Territory earlier in the year.
