Airtime refill cards are available in five denominations, with various expiration periods as shown below. In parentheses is the minimum monthly expenditure if the same denomination refill card is used repeatedly upon the expiration of the previous paid minutes (assumes 360-day year).  Automatic billing to a credit or debit card is also available. Sale tax (if any) will be added. For automatic billing, this will be based on the billing address of the card used.  
Any previously unused airtime balance will be rolled over into the next period if more funds are added the day ''before'' the expiration date. (Company's slogan: "Never lose your airtime.")  Otherwise, the balance resets to zero, and calls and texts cannot be made or received (except 9-1-1 emergency and 6-1-1 customer service). Inactive accounts along with their corresponding phone numbers and frozen voice mail may be cancelled after 60 days. Maximum permissible balance is $300 which cannot grow by more than $150 within one day.
Voice mail is provided for free to all accounts. There is no charge for unanswered incoming voice mail messages or retrieving such messages from another phone using a PIN (will ring 6 to 8 times before access). Regular airtime charges apply for retrieving messages with one's own i-wireless phone. Unlike most other carriers, incoming text messages are also free.
Although i-wireless uses the Sprint network, text messages originating from the internet and other non-cellular systems are not forwarded through from Sprint to i-wireless.  Therefore, only cell phone to cell phone text messaging is possible. 
In 2010, i-wireless offered their first ever smartphone: the Sanyo Zio.  This is a full feature Android phone with a 3-inch touchscreen, 3.2 megapixel camera, and full-function web-browser.
