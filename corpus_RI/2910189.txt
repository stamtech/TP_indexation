Market News First seems to be an newly created news source for the viewing public to utilize at their own discretion.  Without any charges or login reqirements, the site doesn't seem to be advertising their services on Wiki, rather simply stating facts about the company. 
Market News First is in the infancy of becoming competition to a blend of Yahoo and CNBC.  Relying on advertising revenue, as do Yahoo and CNBC, MN1 is making a move into territories not yet explored with the use of live video and audio webcasts via the internet, discussing up to the minute news relating to investments, sports, and entertainment.  This is not meant to be an advertisement, just a factual source of information about this new company and its unique processes.
