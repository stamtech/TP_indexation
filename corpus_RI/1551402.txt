The first Jewish federation was founded in Boston in 1895.  Federations were soon formed in Cincinnati, then in many other cities.
Each federation is autonomous from federations of other cities and they tend to focus on local concerns. The federations typically have elected boards or trustees that are accountable to the community, paid staff, and volunteer leadership.
Federations raise money for central "community chests" that support the organizations of the entire local Jewish community.  Between 30 and 50 percent of Jewish households in the United States typically contribute to their local federation.
They engage in centralized planning for the needs of the local community, and may provide centralized administrative services for their constituent agencies.   Federation spending and efforts have adapted as the need for particular social services has changed   for example, from Jewish orphanage work in the early 1900s to retirement homes in the late 1900s.
More than half of all funds raised by federations are earmarked for various local Jewish social service agencies, with the largest single allocation to Jewish education, typically constituting 25 percent.  After education, Jewish community centers, family and child services, homes for the aged, and campus Hillels are the next largest drawers of financial support.
Jewish federations can wield a sizable degree of influence in the Jewish communities in which they are located.  Many of the local federations hold annual fundraising drives that are expected to raise most of the next year's budgeting for many community programs. In return, in many communities the agencies which receive funding from the federation agree not to engage in major fundraising for themselves for a number of months often called the "primacy period" when the local federation's fundraising has primacy. Decisions made by the local federations can have a great impact on the community, including the opening or closing of programs, staff hirings and firings, and land purchases and sales.
A significant feature of the annual federation campaign is "Super Sunday", a day designated for community-wide phone banking, seeking contributions from members of the community.
The original umbrella organization for the federations was the National Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds.  "National" was dropped from the name in 1935 and "Welfare Funds" was removed in 1979.  
In 1999, the CJF merged with the United Jewish Appeal to become the United Jewish Communities.  In October 2009, the UJC was renamed the Jewish Federations of North America.
After the 2009 launch of the new logo for The Jewish Federations of North America, increasing numbers of local Federations are switching to some variant of that logo. An example is the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington.
Four hundred smaller Jewish communities in North America are members of the Network of Independent Communities, which are administered via the JFNA.
