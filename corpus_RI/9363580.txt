Originally granted a construction permit to build a low power radio station with the call letters KRUU by the FCC in 2001, the Fairfield Youth Advocacy a.k.a.the Beatbox, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, was granted a six month extension in April 2006. At that time a town hall meeting was held and the board of directors was formed. With community-wide volunteer help the station debuted on air on September 30, 2006. Ninety-nine percent(99%) of KRUU's programs are locally produced by volunteer hosts who create 80 shows a week. All original content programs produced at KRUU are archived in a free reference library, available to anyone.
On September 9, 2009 at 9am, KRUU became the first (and only) partially solar-powered radio station in the midwest United States. According to KRUU station manager James Moore, solar panels reduce the stations reliance on the conventional electrical grid by fifteen (15%) to twenty (20%) percent by powering the master control room and transmitter.  Twenty-four Photocomm solar panels each rated sixty-five watts provide a total of one-point-six kilowatts (1.6kw). Battery backup is supplied by ten Interstate GR2-140 12-volt batteries in case of inclement weather.
