Pham was introduced to poker by playing Texas hold 'em in her local casino in Luton.
Pham has finished in the money in Texas hold 'em, seven-card stud and omaha poker tournaments from 2001 onwards, in Southampton, Luton and Dundee.
She came to note as the winner of The Gaming Club World Poker Championship in Dublin during 2004, which was played in pot limit format. In her qualifying heat she outlasted the likes of Peter Costa, Robert Williamson III, Ben Roberts and John Cernuto to progress to the final where she defeated Joe Beevers in the final heads-up confrontation to take home the    250,000 ($302,477) first prize.
She has also finished in the money of five European Poker Tour events, including one final table.
In August 2005, Pham made the final table of the VC Poker Cup, won by Tony Bloom.
