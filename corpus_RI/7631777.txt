 Although the publication said the book was generally sympathetic toward Obama, it also praised Mendell for taking note of his faults and his  "considerable ego", citing in particular the opening of the book, in which Obama confidentially states, "I'm LeBron, baby", before speaking at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Tim Russert, host of NBC's ''Meet the Press'', was particularly impressed with Mendell's frank assessments of Obama's flaws and ambition, such as the statement, "What the public has yet to see clearly is his hidden side, his imperious, mercurial, self-righteous, and sometimes prickly nature, each quality exacerbated by the enormous career pressures that he has inflicted upon himself." A WLS-TV review of ''Obama: From Promise to Power'' said the book "carries with it a certain oral history-style wholeness", due to the variety of people it profiled from Obama's life. The review said Mendell's long history of first-hand news coverage of Obama lended the book "both an insider's perspective and a journalist's shrewd critical eye, and the portrait that he paints of Obama is more comprehensive than any previous treatment of this remarkable man".
In February 2008, ''Obama: From Promise to Power'' won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work in the Biography/Autobiography category.
