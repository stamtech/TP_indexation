Yahoo! Movies devotes special coverage to the Academy Awards with a special Oscars site.  The Oscars site includes articles, show coverage, a list of the night's big winners, photos, videos, polls, and a blog, written by J. Keith van Straaten.
From 2002 to 2007, Yahoo! Movies was the home of Greg's Previews of Upcoming Movies, an enhanced version of Upcomingmovies.com, written by its creator, Greg Dean Schmitz.  During much of this time, Schmitz frequently appeared in print, radio and television as a representative of Yahoo! Movies.
Yahoo! Movies also releases special guides, such as the Summer Movie Guide, which contains information on the major releases of the summer with exclusive trailers and clips, photos, box office information, polls, and unique editorial content.
Additionally, Yahoo! Movies is teaming up with MTV to host a special site for the MTV Movie Awards, which will feature show information and a section where users can submit original movie shorts parodying last year's movies for the chance to win the new award, ''Best Movie Spoof''.
