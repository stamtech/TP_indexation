This route dates back to April 1949, when it was introduced between Sidcup and Farnborough. In 1958 it was extended to Blackfen during the peaks, although this was withdrawn four years later. A Saturday and Sunday extension to Welling in 1958 was followed by a further extension to Woolwich in 1963, and a year later this extension was made into an all-week operation. Another extension in 1964 saw the route run to Hayes. Some peak hour journeys ran to Victoria Way in Woolwich, but these were replaced by a new route 51A in 1968.
In 1977 the 51 was converted to one-man operation and was extended during Monday to Friday peak hours from Woolwich to Charlton station. In the same year the route was diverted to run to Green Street Green instead of Farnborough. In 1982 it was again diverted to serve Orpington station. The Woolwich - Charlton section was withdrawn in 1982. In 1986 some Monday to Friday peak hour journeys were diverted back in to Green Street Green, but these were withdrawn in 1989.
In August 1985 operation of the route was taken over by Kentish Bus with second-hand Leyland Atlanteans. The route remained with them for seven years, being won by London Central from their former Selkent garage at Bexleyheath (BX) in 1992. Central introduced second-hand Leyland Titans onto the route; in 1995 they were replaced on retender by new Volvo Olympians. These were replaced in turn by low-floor Volvo B7TLs in 2003.
In 2008 the company lost the route 51 contract to Selkent. Selkent had bid for the route (under the London Tendering scheme) numerous times before but won this time due to London Central's inaccurate recording of lost mileage.
In 2009 overcrowding on the route led to a knife attack on a Police Community Support Officer in Orpington. Four teenagers were arrested.
