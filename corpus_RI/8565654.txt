The '''2009 Volvo World Match Play Championship''' was the 45th Volvo World Match Play Championship played, the first for two years and the first time at Finca Cortesin Golf Club. It was held from 29 October to 1 November, with the champion receiving    750,000. A new format was introduced, with the sixteen players split into four groups of four, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. Once again it is an official money event on the European Tour.
Substitutions were made from various sources.
The sixteen players were split into four groups of four, seeded by their World Ranking. Within each group, every player will play each other in a round robin format over full 18-hole matches. Each match will complete 18 holes every time. Points will be awarded based upon win (2), tie (1) or loss (0). The leading player from each group will qualify for the semi-final knockout stage. In case of ties, aggregate number of holes won will be used to determine the winner.
The semi-finals and finals will be played over 36 holes in head-to-head match play.
