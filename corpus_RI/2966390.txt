Its blue buses provide a regular service between Leeds, Tadcaster, York and Malton, and also serve the coastal resorts of Scarborough, Whitby, Bridlington and Filey, as well as the popular inland town of Pickering and the village of Thornton-le-Dale on the North Yorkshire Moors National Park.
In early 2006, the company became 100% low-floor when six Volvo B7TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini entered service, the original intention having been to have seven (the last one was diverted to Harrogate & District). In 2008, Yorkshire Coastliner replaced all of its single-deck B7RLEs and some older double-deckers with 10 new Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini. The whole Yorkshire Coastliner service was being run with double-deckers from Summer 2008. However, in 2009 several Optare Versa single-deck buses were transferred from other Transdev subsidiaries to allow for the operation of new routes 743/844 to compete against First's new X64 route from Leeds to York.

Yorkshire Coastliner has satellite technology installed on 20 buses to track the vehicles' progress and keep passengers informed of delays.
Yorkshire Coastliner participates in the Moorsbus scheme. It accepts Moorsbus tickets between Malton and Whitby on Moorsbus dates. In addition to this, Yorkshire Coastliner freedom tickets are accepted on all Moorsbus services.
