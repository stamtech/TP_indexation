Yahoo! Live was launched on February 6, 2008 as a "limited preview" and in spite of Yahoo!'s rejection to Microsoft's offer just a few days earlier, the site crashed the same night it was launched due to lack of bandwidth. 
On November 3, 2008, Yahoo! Live announced that the service would be ended on Dec. 3. 
It was officially discontinued at 7:07 P.M. EST on Dec. 3 2008 with the message "kthxbai" posted on the main page.
The design is similar to the one on Justin.tv. The chat system and video windows are as portable as with ustream.tv. Users can create a channel, authorize their webcam and start broadcasting to the public. Other people can watch, or choose to participate via video, sound or text chat; which can be disabled. Users can also set up profiles and track how many people have watched them stream live, how many broadcasts they have made, and how long they have been on the streaming. Unfortunately, videos are not archived for playback, once it   s broadcast, there is no way of recovering the video, and the is no other way of streaming unless it's live, meaning users cannot pre-record videos and then broadcast them.
