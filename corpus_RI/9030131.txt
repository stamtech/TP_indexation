It is now the largest railway station in Asia.
Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, located in Changning District of Shanghai, is a major part of the Hongqiao Comprehensive Transportation Hub (   the Hongqiao hub   ). The station achieves a zero-distance transfer with the Terminal 2 of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. 
The construction of the railway station began on July 20, 2008 with a total investment of more than 
CNY 15 billion ($2.3 billion).It is opened on July 1, 2010, simultaneously with the opening of the Huning High-Speed Railway line.
The railway Station takes a total area of about 1.3 million square meters with a huge waiting hall and 30 platforms, most of which are high speed rail configuration.
The station is primarily served as the Shanghai terminus of high speed rail line, such as Shanghai   Nanjing High-Speed Railway line and the Shanghai   Hangzhou High-Speed Railway line. In the near future, the Beijing   Shanghai High-Speed Railway line, which is currently under construction will be added to the service and will become the most important high speed rail line in China. In addition, the station has some normal intercity lines as well.
Most long-haul non-high speed trains to the North and South of China depart from either the Shanghai main station or Shanghai South station.
The station was built with a ground-transportation which provides a fast and scenic link to inner Shanghai. It can be reached by two Shanghai Metro lines, Line 2 and Line 10. It is also accessible by numerous bus lines and taxi.
A solar system of  20,000 solar panels, with a total area of 61,000 sq m, installed on the awnings of the station, has been described as "the world's largest stand alone integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) project". With the power output of 6.68 Megawatt, the system can produce 6.3 million kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity per year.
