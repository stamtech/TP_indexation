Butler was born in Virginia.
The Red Devils (originally known as The Blue Shadows) released one album, 1992's ''King King''.  It was produced by Rick Rubin on his Def American record label. The group featured drummer Bill Bateman (The Blasters), plus Paul Size on lead guitar and pianist Gene Taylor. The Red Devils were known for backing Mick Jagger on the Rubin produced sessions for the album ''Wandering Spirit'', though those tracks were not issued at the time (they have since cropped up on various bootlegs, and one track was officially released on a Mick Jagger compilation on Rhino Records in 2007). The band also backed actor and sometime musician Bruce Willis, when the action star performed at his Planet Hollywood clubs. The Devils also backed Johnny Cash on music that was not released until the country singer's death, on the boxed set ''Unearthed''.
After the break up of The Red Devils, Butler also fronted the band, 13, releasing one self-titled record on Hightone Records in 1997. The original members of 13 included    Kid Ramos on guitar, James Intveld on bass, and Johnny Morgan on drums. The recorded release of 13 on Hightone Records and produced by Warren Croyle features Stephen Hodges and Johnny Morgan on drums, Tom Levey and James Moore on bass, Andy Kaulkin on keyboards, Alex Schultz, Smokey Hormel, Paul Bryant, and Doug Hamlin on guitar. He achieved his greatest fame in Europe and especially the Netherlands, where the Lester Butler Tribute Band still performs.
Butler died of an overdose of heroin and cocaine on May 10, 1998, in Los Angeles at the age of 38. Two of his friends were convicted in his death with involuntary manslaughter. - accessed July 2010
