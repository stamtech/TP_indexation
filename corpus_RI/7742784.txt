On November 19, 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Davis to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota vacated by Harry H. MacLaughlin. Confirmed by the Senate on March 25, 1994, Davis received his commission on March 28, 1994.

In October 2007, Davis presided over the case of ''Capitol v. Thomas''. The Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group of recording companies, filed suit against Jammie Thomas for copyright infringement for 24 songs that she had shared on Kazaa. The jury jury returned a verdict against her in the amount of $222,000 ($9,250 per song file). However, Davis granted motion for a new trial on September 24, 2008 when he ruled that the jury was given flawed instructions, and that this constituted a "manifest error of law."
The federal judge had overturned the $222,000 copyright infringement verdict against Jammie Thomas. He also called on Congress to fix the Copyright Act so that the RIAA can't get six-figure judgments for P2P use. Thomas was granted a retrial, later she received a fine of $80,000 per song leading to a sum of $1.9 million. Thomas, a single mother of 3, has not stated how she would repay the record companies.
Davis has served as an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota Law School since 1982 and at William Mitchell College of Law from 1977 to 1981. He has also been an instructor at the Minnesota Institute of Legal Education since 1990.
