Mitchell High School opened in 1978 as the result of consolidation of all high schools in Mitchell County. It was built in the small unincorporated community of Ledger between the only two municipalities of Mitchell County, Spruce Pine, North Carolina and Bakersville, North Carolina. For some students in the more remote areas of the county such as Pigeon Roost and Poplar, a school bus ride of over an hour is not uncommon.
The population growth of Mitchell County has not been significant since 19781 and therefore it is not surprising that the enrollment of Mitchell High school has also not increased. In 1978, enrollment was near 9002. In 1988 enrollment was down to between 700 and 7502. As of 2006, enrollment is approximately 6863. Expect around 700 to be the enrollment for the next several years.
