The '''Volvo Halifax Assembly Plant''' located in Halifax, Nova Scotia was opened on 11 June 1963 by H.R.H Prince Bertil.  It was the only North American assembly plant Volvo ever opened.  Volvo decided to open to the plant to bypass hefty North American import tariffs on foreign goods and to capitalize on the newly signed Canadian/American Auto Pact.
The Halifax plant was unlike another assembly plant Volvo was operating at the time. This was mainly due to the plants trademark team system that assembled the entire vehicle at one station extensively used later at Volvo Torslanda Assembly and then Volvo Kalmar Assembly. In 1966, annual production totalled over 3,700 cars. Volvo 122 S, 123 GT and 122 B18s  were assembled in Halifax initially, the Volvo PV544 was introduced a year later.  Halifax-built 123 GT models like the 122 S were rebadged as "Canadian GT"s. Units produced at the plant typically came without the auxiliary lights and had only one sideview mirror but came with limited-slip differential and hazard flashers. Halifax-built Canadian GTs were available in colours such as light green (91), light blue (95) and dark blue (96) and are often seen with identification codes 5145 or 5324. For three years the plant operated out of a harbourfront facility (old sugar processing plant) located on Halifax Harbour's Eastern Passage.
In 1967, the plant was moved to a newer  facility in Clayton Park, Nova Scotia (Bayer   s Lake) which enabled production to exceed 8,000 cars per year. Cars were shipped from Sweden in CKD form, then assembled at the facility.

In 1993, the plant celebrated its 30th anniversary. To mark the occasion 940s built at the facility were affixed with a special roundel affixed to the rear quarter window.
While the plant was very successful, on September 9, 1998 Volvo decided to close the Halifax plant and end its 225 jobs, citing globalization and NAFTA as two of the reasons. The last Volvo was built in Canada on 18 December 1998. The Bayer's Lake plant building at 115 Chain Lake Drive still stands.
Shortly after the closure announcement the plant became the focus of a dispute between Volvo and the Canadian Auto Workers Union. On 21 October 1998,
The first Volvo produced at the facility, also the first Volvo produced outside of Sweden, is a black 1963 Volvo 122 B18 currently on permanent display at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.
In 1969, roughly twenty Volvo bodies intended for the plant were dumped into the Bedford Basin after incurring severe water damage in transit across the Atlantic Ocean on a container ship.
In 1980, two Canadians broke the Guinness World record for the fastest time around the world in a Halifax-built Volvo 245 DL nicknamed Red Cloud. Ken Langley and Gary Sowerby completed the feat in just 74 days, 1 hour and 11 minutes, smashing the previous record by over a month.
Shortly before the plant's closure, popular Canadian comedy/satire show ''This Hour Has 22 Minutes'' and correspondant Mary Walsh filmed an entire segment at the plant.
The Canadian Museum of Science and Technology paid tribute to the plant by featuring a 1989 Volvo 740 GLE that had been produced at that plant in a permanent exhibit entitled "''The Quest in Search of the Canadian Car''".
