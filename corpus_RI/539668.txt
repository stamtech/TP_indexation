The company originally started by Scott Hassan in January, 1997, as an email archiving service called FindMail.  Carl B. Page joined the company part-time in May 1997.  In December, 1997, Hassan decided to add the ability to host free mailing lists and called the new product MakeList.com.   Martin Roscheisen joined as CEO in March 1998.   Makelist.com quickly grew to 250,000 users before taking a venture finance round of $810,000 from Atlas Venture in May 1998.  The post-money valuation was set at $4.5m.  In June, 1998, the company was renamed '''eGroups.com'''.  In October, 1998, with 1.2 million users (growing at 12,000 users per day), the company had an offer on the table from Excite for $40m but decided instead to take $5.1 million more investment money from Sequoia Capital.  
In November 1999, ONElist and eGroups merged and started work on an initial public offering, as eGroups.com, with 13 million users exchanging more than 1.3 billion email messages each month.  In January 2000, the company raised a further $42 million and filed a S1 with the SEC on March 23, 2000.
In August 2000 with 18 million users, the company was purchased by Yahoo! for $413m in a stock deal and became Yahoo! Groups.
