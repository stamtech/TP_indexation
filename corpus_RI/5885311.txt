Ferris won his bracelet at the 1980 World Series of Poker, winning $150,000. He defeated some of the best professional poker players of that time to win the tournament, including two-time world champion Doyle Brunson who finished the tournament in second place, and 1978 world champion Bobby Baldwin who finished third.  
He also won a tournament at the Super Bowl of Poker, organized by Amarillo Slim. Ferris was mainly a cash game player, but also had tournament winnings exceeding $200,000. 
On April 22, 1983, Ferris gained notoriety as the Internal Revenue Service seized $46,000 during a high stakes game at the Horseshoe Casino.
Ferris died in March 1989, and was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in December of that year.
