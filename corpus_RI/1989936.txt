Each episode opened with Rose discussing an element of poker strategy with a professional poker player associated with the Full Tilt site, usually Howard Lederer. The discussion was illustrated with footage from one or more hands from Poker Superstars or another FSN-televised poker tournament. The point was further illustrated by the play of a mock hand by actors, once showing the play without following the tip and once following it. Tips ranged from such basic points of strategy as starting hand selection to more advanced plays like semi-bluffing and slowplaying.
In another segment, Rose hosted a roundtable discussion among several pros like Annie Duke, Phil Hellmuth, Mike Matusow, Daniel Negreanu and others. Initially the pros expanded on the tip of the episode, relating personal experiences with the play and sometimes illustrated by another videotaped hand in which one or more of the pros was involved. The final segment returned to the pros and may have touched again on the tip of the episode or ranged to another unrelated topic.
