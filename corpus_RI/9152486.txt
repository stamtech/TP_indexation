The '''von Ammendorf''' family, now extinct, was a family of Brandenburg nobility from which the von Blumenthal and von Grabow families originated.
The earliest known member was Fritz von Ammendorf who took part in a tournament in 969 in Merseburg. The next documentary reference to the family is in 1224 when Albertus de Ammendorf is mentioned. The continuous family tree begins in 1239 with Heinemann von Ammendorf. An Albertus de Ammendorf appears in 1263   71 as Provincial Governor of the Bailliwick of Thuringen in the county of Zwatzen. There is a documentary reference in 1266 to Heinricus de Ammendorf nobilis vir. The family appears in Merseburg and in and around Halle, and later also had villages in the diocese of Magdeburg and near Rothenburg. The family died out with Conrad von Ammendorf in 1550.
