The '''Wright Crusader''' is a single-decker bus body built by Wright on Dennis Dart SLF and Volvo B6LE chassis. The '''Wright Crusader 2''' was built on the B6LE's successor, the Volvo B6BLE.
Early Crusaders have tall, square-cornered or Gasket side windows and a shallow roofline, similar to the previous Wright Handybus. Later Crusaders, and all Crusader 2s, have shallower windows with a deeper panel above, bringing them in line with other designs like the Endurance and Pathfinder.
Current operators include Arriva North West, Avon Buses, National Express West Midlands, First Manchester, Transdev Yellow Buses and Stagecoach Merseyside amongst others.
