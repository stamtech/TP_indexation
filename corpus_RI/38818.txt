The county is named for the Irish province of Ulster, then an earldom of the Duke of York (later James II).
The area of present day Ulster County was called Esopus by the first European settlers. In 1652 Thomas Chambers a freeholder from Rensselearwyck purchased land at Esopus and began trading there.
In 1683, the Duke of York created twelve counties in his province. Ulster County was one of them. Its boundaries at that time included the present Sullivan County, and portions of the present Delaware, Orange, and Greene Counties.
In 1777, the capital of New York State (the first state capital of independent New York) was established at Kingston, though it was subsequently moved to Wawarsing when the British burned that city.
In 1797, portions of Otsego and Ulster Counties were split off to create Delaware County.
In 1798, the southernmost towns in Ulster County were moved into Orange County, to compensate Orange for breaking away the southernmost portion of that county in order to form Rockland County.
In 1800, portions of Albany and Ulster Counties were split off to create Greene County.
In 1809, Sullivan County was split off from Ulster County.
During the American Civil War volunteers were recruited from the more affluent families of the County to form the 139th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment.

Ulster had long had a county-scale version of a council-manager government, with the county legislature hiring a county administrator to handle executive functions. The chair of the legislature had a great deal of power and was only accountable to the voters of his own district. The only countywide elected officials were the district attorney, Holley Carnright, 2008 to present and sheriff, Paul Vanblarcum, 2007 to present. 
In 2006, voters approved the first-ever county charter, changing to an elected executive branch. Two years later,  Mike Hein, the last appointed county administrator, became Ulster's first elected county executive.
Legislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 33 members representing 22 different communities, separated into 12 districts.  The county charter mandated that the legislature be restructured by creating 23 single-member districts, a process that began in late 2010.http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2011/01/17/news/doc4d3366fada7e1324007403.txt?viewmode=fullstory The current composition of the Legislature is as follows (16 Republicans, 15 Democrats and 2 Conservatives who caucus with the Republicans):
