Nader stars as Joe Shannon, an insurance investigator for the Transport Bonding and Surety Company. Regis Toomey portrayed Shannon's boss, Bill Cochran. Shannon drove a modern 1961 Buick Special, equipped with cameras, a dictating machine, tape recorders, weapons, and notably, a mobile phone (decades before cell phones) when car phones were rare.  The car required a long whip antenna required for the phone.
Jerry Briskin produced the series for Screen Gems. Gene Roddenberry did some of the teleplay.
