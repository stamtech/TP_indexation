The music video starts off with scenes of the promotional cover for the song. Then it shows a split screen of Shiloh in the left and a girl in the right wearing a yellow dress with a dog in her handbag, talking on her cell phone. They're both walking down a street, Shiloh has two other dancers behind her. The other girl has many unfortunate things happen to her   her cell phone's stolen; she spills her drink all over herself; her dog escapes from her handbag; she gets her sunglasses caught in her hair; and she gets dirty water thrown on her. The split screens switch simultaneously throughout the video; sometimes Shiloh will be on the right and the other girl is on the left. In the final minute of the video Shiloh has more people walking down the street behind her, dancing along to the music. It ends with Shiloh showing her knuckles to the camera with letters spelling "Operator" written on them. 
The music video was shot on Kensington Avenue, located in Toronto, Canada.
It has gained some airplay on Canadian TV music stations such as MuchMusic, and Family.
