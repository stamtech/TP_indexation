The deal was to prove costly for both DaimlerChrysler shareholders and for Schrempp personally, whose part in the deal contributed to his eventual replacement at the helm of DCX in 2006., ''Bloomberg News'', July 28, 2005
Jurgen Schrempp was one of the primary architects of the ''"Welt AG"'' plan, developed by Daimler-Benz to increase its presence in the American and Asian markets, and to improve its profitability. Schrempp believed that a modern automaker needed a full range of products beyond the luxury vehicle market in which Mercedes-Benz competed, and began looking for a partner as soon as he became chairman in 1994., Karen Lowry Miller & Joann Muller, ''BusinessWeek'', November 5, 1998 The Chrysler Corporation was targeted in 1995,, Ed Garsten, ''The Detroit News'', November 26, 2003 and on January 12, 1998 he met with Chrysler chairman Bob Eaton with the intent of negotiating a merger/takeover., Henrik Bohme, DW-World.de, May 7, 2003 Following its completion in May that year, Schrempp then turned to Asia.
However, DaimlerChrysler's first steps came to nothing. It considered but ultimately declined to invest in Nissan prior to the Japanese company's alliance with Renault,, Jack Ewing, Emily Thornton & Moon Ihlwan, ''BusinessWeek International'', December 13, 1999 and it was rumoured that they also courted Honda that same year. Schrempp, who had given a speech in Tokyo in early 1999 where he predicted DCX's market share in Asia would increase from 1.3 to over 10&nbsp;percent, began to come under pressure to deliver on his promises.
Mitsubishi Motors was DaimlerChrysler's third choice partner, but in 1999 MMC chairman Katsuhiko Kawasoe rebuffed their initial approach. However, in the aftermath of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis MMC was saddled with   1.7&nbsp;trillion of debt,, Brian Bremner, Emily Thornton, and Irene M. Kunii, ''BusinessWeek'', March 15, 1999, Funding Universe.com and some outside analysts were suggesting that the company should give priority to becoming a takeover or merger target., Gerry Kobe, ''Automotive Industries'', August 1999 Kawasoe rejected this, preferring to present Mitsubishi as an equal partner to potential suitors, adding that Mitsubishi would continue to follow their longstanding approach of establishing ventures without capital tie-ups. But eventually a deal was struck: DCX would purchase a controlling 34&nbsp;percent stake in the company for   450&nbsp;billion (   2.1&nbsp;billion)., ''CNN Money'', March 27, 2000, Murakami Mutsuko, ''Asiaweek'' vol.26, no.13, April 7, 2000, This would ostensibly preserve Mitsubishi's "independence", as only three out of the company's ten board members would be elected by the new largest shareholder, although DaimlerChrysler did now possess a veto power over boardroom decisions., John Schmid, ''International Herald Tribune'', March 23, 2000 For DCX, the benefit would come from increased market share without MMC's debts appearing on their balance sheet.
Shortly after the deal was finalised, Mitsubishi became embroiled in accusations that it had covered up complaints from customers about defects in their vehicles., BBC News, July 19, 2000 A police raid on its headquarters in July 2000 uncovered hidden documents stashed in a locker, and soon after over 500,000 vehicles were recalled for repairs. Mitsubishi's shares fell by 13&nbsp;percent as these revelations became public, and over the summer, further investigations took a similar toll on the company's stock. By the end of August, following a second police raid, the total number of vehicles recalled had reached one million, while the share price had fallen by almost 30&nbsp;percent., BBC News, August 13, 2000, BBC News, August 28, 2000 As a result of the collapse in the value of Mitsubishi, DaimlerChrysler renegotiated a    200&nbsp;million reduction price of its stock purchase, while Kawasoe was forced to step down as chairman., BBC News, September 8, 2000, Takuya Ito, Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies, April 15, 2006
Mitsubishi's difficulties contributed to a sharp fall in the DaimlerChrysler group's profits, and following the recall of a further 1.5&nbsp;million cars in February 2001, including almost a million in the U.S.,, BBC News, February 15, 2001 the German parent moved quickly to restructure; approximately 10,000 Mitsubishi employees would be axed and one of its four assembly plants would be closed., BBC News, February 26, 2001
The following month, DaimlerChrysler approached Volvo about acquiring the Swedish automaker's 3.3&nbsp;percent stake in Mitsubishi. Volvo had planned on forming a joint venture with MMC for bus and truck manufacturing as part of a deal originally negotiated in 1999, until the involvement of DaimlerChrysler, a rival in the commercial vehicle marketplace, led Volvo to ultimately withdraw., BBC News, March 8, 2001 The    760&nbsp;million sale was concluded in April 2001, taking DCX's share to 37.3&nbsp;percent., Mitsubishi Motors press release, April 11, 2001
Olivier Boulay, then the head of DaimlerChrysler's Japanese design studio in Yokohama, was recruited by Mitsubishi in May 2001., Mitsubishi Motors press release, April 25, 2001 Answering directly to Rolf Eckrodt, the DCX-appointed Chief Operating Officer, Boulay's appointment was part of the "Turnaround Plan" initiated by Eckrodt and new Chief Executive Takashi Sonobe, where Mitsubishi tried to move away from an engineering-led approach to development., Mitsubishi Motors press release, March 28, 2001 Despite the new initiatives and increased investment, Mitsubishi Motors announced a revised profit forecast in April 2001,, Mitsubishi Motors press release, March 28, 2001 and their downward projections were confirmed in May when the company reported a net loss for the year of   278&nbsp;billion., Mitsubishi Motors press release, May 18, 2001

Despite DaimlerChrysler's involvement, debts at Mitsubishi continued to accumulate. A torporous economy in Japan dragged down the company's domestic performance in 2003, while the same year the after effects of a disastrous credit scheme in the U.S. saw Mitsubishi Motors North America suffer a US$454&nbsp;million loss., BBC News, November 11, 2003 Mitsubishi Motors press release, November 11, 2003 By 2004 the automaker owed   1.14&nbsp;trillion, and a   700&nbsp;billion rescue plan was put to shareholders in April., BBC News, April 23, 2004 Other companies within the ''keiretsu'' of Mitsubishi which owned 23 percent of MMC were committed to the plan, and the Japan Development Bank had also been approached for support., BBC News, April 2, 2004
However, at DaimlerChrysler there was dissent against the idea of further investment; only weeks before Schrempp had endured calls for his resignation from shareholders., Alexander Huebner and Chang-Ran Kim, ''Forbes'', April 23, 2004 In the face of this and his the boardroom's opposition, DCX refused to pledge further funds, and formally stated that it would no longer financially support its partner. Sarah Buckley, BBC News, October 13, 2004 Japan's finance minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, commented that the decision "could affect the future of the company", while corporate analysts were more forthright, calling it "a disaster" and claiming that " will vanish if it continues this way."
An alternative rescue package was formulated by May 2004, involving a   450&nbsp;billion investment in newly issued stock by U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase, Tokyo-based private investment fund Phoenix Capital and other Mitsubishi Group companies. The deal was announced as MMC reported a loss for the year of   215&nbsp;billion., BBC News, May 21, 2004 Further negotiations, and the involvement of the China Motor Corporation, boosted this figure to   546&nbsp;billion by June, in return for 11,000 redundancies and cuts to corporate pensions, salaries and bonuses., BBC News, June 29, 2004 As a result of the new investment, DaimlerChrysler's own stake was diluted.
Profitability remained out of reach for Mitsubishi, and enlarged losses in 2005 were forecast by the company. The company's stock price slid 41 percent in 2004 to approximately one quarter the value of when DaimlerChrysler first became involved., BBC News, November 8, 2004
 Soon after, Chrysler's Chief Operating Officer Wolfgang Bernhard also parted ways with the German parent over its continuing troubles and falling profits,, Dean Slavnich, Automotive Engineer-Plus, July 30, 2004 while the merger with MMC was now routinely being referred to by the media as a "debacle"., Gail Edmondson, ''BusinessWeek'', August 2, 2004, Leonie Wood, ''The Age'', April 27, 2004 A third attempt to recapitalize Mitsubishi in January 2005 led to   540&nbsp;billion of further investment,, BBC News, January 28, 2005, Naoko Fujimura, ''International Herald Tribune'', February 15, 2005 and DaimlerChrysler's now owned only a 12.4 percent stake.

BBC News, November 11, 2005 Three days later the buyer, investment bank Goldman Sachs sold the shares on for US$80&nbsp;million profit. ''Automotive Business Review'', November 18, 2005
New major stockholder Phoenix Capital followed suit the following month, selling all but 50&nbsp;million of its 575&nbsp;million shares to JPMorgan on December 9, 2005, and once again the investment bank offloaded their purchase within a few days for tens of millions of dollars in profit. In both cases, the eventual buyers were part of the Mitsubishi ''keiretsu'', returning MMC to Japanese ownership.
