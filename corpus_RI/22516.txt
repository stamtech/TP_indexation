  Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post.  It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Townsip was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter., accessed February 04, 2011  It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev.

The settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893 out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mount Road. The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace.
The Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of Center Line, which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936. Between 1950 and 1960, Warren's population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was fueled in part by white flight from its southern neighbor of Detroit in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city's population doubled again. As the community has matured, its population has begun to gradually grow.

Warren was one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country between 1940 and 1970, roughly doubling its population every 10 years. In 1940 the official population of Warren Township was 22,146; in 1950, it was 42,653; in 1960, after Warren Township had become the City of Warren, population had risen to 89,240; and by 1970 it had grown to 179,260.
Since 1970, Warren has been consistently one of the faster-declining cities in population in the country. The population declined by 10% during each of the next two decades (1980: 161,060; 1990: 144,864), and dropped by 4.6% between 1990 and 2000. Warren   s population is currently one of the oldest among large cities in the United States. 17.3% of Warren's population was 65 or older at the last census, tied for fifth with Hollywood, Florida among cities with 100,000+ population, and in fact the highest-ranking city by this measure outside of Florida or Hawaii.

Residents of Warren on average have lived in that community 35.5 years, compared to the national average of eight years for communities of 100,000+ population.

(Another Detroit suburb Livonia, held the distinction of being America's "whitest city" as of the 2000 Census.) The white population has dropped only gradually in the past few decades, to 98.2% in 1980, 97.3% in 1990, and 91.3% in 2000. However the 2000 figure for non-Hispanic whites was 90.4%, while 2010 saw an all-time low of 57.1%.
