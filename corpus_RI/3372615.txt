Hi! Wouldn't it be fine to have a California State Route 1 map? It would be great if someone find some time to draw that one... --  21:07, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi. Can someone help me to draw a map of Interstate 87 in New York(with shields). Thank you. --
A map of NY 208 would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. --    -   02:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
Hi... I was wondering if I could obtain a map of California State Route 78 for a prototype infobox? Since I'm proposing map support for CA...  Thanks, '''  (  -  ) ''' 01:51, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
I think this illustrates my point about detail possibly being bad: when SR 15 becomes I-15, this map will be out-of-date. I'm not sure if this is a big deal though.
By the way, what do you mean about "map support"? If you use  , you'll be able to include a map - and anything else that other states use - by default. --  07:44, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
Much thanks... at this point it'll be a few years before CA-15 becomes I-15. --'''  (  -  ) ''' 01:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
A map for I-410 (loop around San Antonio) would be great. Thanks. --  16:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
We need an updated map. The old map was drawn when we had far less data than we do now. I also have a reference in the reference list which shows a map from some slides from a Professor at  University of Alabama that you can compare your map with. Thanks.--  02:34, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
