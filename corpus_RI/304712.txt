GeoCities was originally founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner in late 1994 as '''Beverly Hills Internet''' (BHI).  In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to place their web pages. The "cities" were named after real cities or regions according to their content     for example, computer-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with entertainment were assigned to "Hollywood"     hence the name of the site.
 There were at least 38 million user-built pages on GeoCities before it was shut down. The GeoCities Japan version of the service is still available.
GeoCities began in mid-1995 as BHI, which stood for Beverly Hills Internet, a small Web hosting and development company in Southern California.
 At that point GeoCities was headquartered at 9401 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. By December 1996 it was headquartered on the third floor of 1918 Main Street in Santa Monica, with an office on the 8th floor of 125 Park Avenue in Manhattan, New York City.
Over time, many companies, including Yahoo!, invested extensively in GeoCities and, with the introduction of paid premium services, the site continued to grow. In May 1997, GeoCities introduced advertisements on its pages. Despite negative reaction from users, GeoCities continued to grow. By June 1997, GeoCities was the fifth most popular site on the Web, and by October of that year the company had signed up its millionth Homesteader.
In June 1998, in an effort to increase brand awareness, GeoCities introduced a watermark to user web pages. The watermark, much like an onscreen graphic on some television channels, was a transparent floating GIF which used JavaScript to stay on the bottom right side of the browser screen. Many users felt the watermark interfered with the design of their website and threatened to move their web pages elsewhere. The watermark also had cross-browser issues. GeoCities claimed in a press release that the company had received upbeat feedback regarding the watermark.
 The headquarters had moved to 4499 Glencoe Avenue in Los Angeles, near the Marina del Rey area of Los Angeles County.
In January 1999, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, GeoCities was purchased by Yahoo! for $3.57 billion in stock, with Yahoo! taking control on May 28.
On April 23, 2009, Yahoo! announced that it would be closing its United States branch of GeoCities, and stopped accepting new registrations, though the existing GeoCities accounts remained active. In late June 2009, Yahoo! updated the GeoCities home page to indicate: "GeoCities is closing on October 26, 2009." GeoCities joined a long list of other services discontinued by Yahoo such as: Farechase, Launchcast, My Web, Audio Search, Pets, Live, Kickstart, Briefcase and Yahoo! for Teachers.
 Yahoo! encouraged users to upgrade their accounts to the fee-based Yahoo! Web Hosting service.
Rupert Goodwins, the editor of ''ZDNet'', perceived the closure of GeoCities as an end of an era; he described GeoCities as "the first proof that you could have something really popular and still not make any money on the internet." Vijay Mukhi, an internet and cyber security expert quoted in the ''Business Standard'', criticized Yahoo's handling of GeoCities; Mukhi described GeoCities as "a lost opportunity for Yahoo! They could have made it a Facebook if they wanted." Rich Skrenta, the CEO of Blekko, posted on Twitter an offer to take over GeoCities from Yahoo! in exchange for 50% future revenue share.
In response to the closure, rival webhosting services began to compete for the web sites leaving GeoCities. For instance, German web host Jimdo started the "Lifeboat for GeoCities" service to encourage GeoCities users to put their websites on Jimdo. ''Geocities-closing.com'', started by GeoCities competitor uCoz, is a similar project launched to save GeoCities websites.
Shortly after the GeoCities closing announcement, the Internet Archive announced a project to archive GeoCities pages, stating "GeoCities has been an important outlet for personal expression on the Web for almost 15 years." Internet Archive made it their task to ensure the thoroughness and completeness of their archive of GeoCities sites.
Another site which is attempting to build an archive of defunct GeoCities web sites is GeoCities.ws.  Although it is using the GeoCities name, it is not clear from the site what its relationship with the original GeoCities is. Other sites with this purpose are Geociti.es and WebCite.
In the first anniversary from Geocities closing, The Archive Team released a torrent file archive of 641 GB (prior to 7zip compression, it was approximately 900 GB of data).
On April 16, 2011, The Archive Team released a patch to the first Geocities torrent (originally released on October 29, 2010)  
The domain ''geocities.com'' attracted at least 177 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study.
ComScore stated that the Geocities had 18.9 million unique visitors from the U.S. in March 2006. In March 2008 Geocities had 15.1 million unique U.S. visitors. In March 2009 Geocities had 11.5 million unique visitors, a 24% decline from March 2008.
The litigation came about in this way: GeoCities provided free home pages and e-mail address to children and adults who provided personally identifying and demographic information when they registered for the website. At the time of the complaint, GeoCities had more than 1.8 million members who were "homesteaders." GeoCities illegally permitted third-party advertisers to promote products targeted to GeoCities' 1.8 million users, by using personally identifiable information obtained in the registration process. These acts and practices affected "commerce" as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission.
The problem GeoCities faced was that it placed a privacy statement on its New Member Application Form and on its website promising that it would never give personally identifying information to anyone without the user's permission. GeoCities sold personal information to third parties who used the information for purposes other than those for which members gave permission.
It was ordered that GeoCities would not make any misrepresentation, in any manner about its collection or use of personal identifying information, including what information will be disclosed to third parties. GeoCities was not allowed to collect personal identifying information from any child if GeoCities had actual knowledge that the child did not have his parents' permission to provide the information.
 By 1999 GeoCities had additional neighborhoods and refocused existing neighborhoods.
In 1999 GeoCities had an online commercial presence with GeoCities Marketplace. It included the GeoStore, which sold GeoCities-branded merchandise. Users cashed in GeoPoints in the store.
Prior to the takeover by Yahoo!, GeoCities had a Japanese subsidiary, GeoCities Japan. GeoCities Japan was based on Japanese culture. GeoCities Japan was headquartered in the Nihonbashi Hakozaki Building in the Nihonbashi area of Chuo, Tokyo.
As of February 27, 2011, GeoCities Japan is still online, with no signs of upcoming closure.  Its member sites are still accessible, and it is still accepting new account registrations, but now all services are only available in Japanese.
GeoCities Japan has the following neighborhoods:
