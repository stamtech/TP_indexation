The film argues that American presidents since the 1960s have served as "front men" for entities such as the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Wall Street banks, the Federal Reserve, the Military-industrial complex and others, arguing that multinational corporations and powerful elite families, such as the  Rothschild family and Rockefeller family hold the real "power behind the throne." The documentary claims the main motive of these groups is to set up a New World Order where offshore banks subversively engage in the looting of the wealth of the American people. The documentary primarily focuses on American president Barack Obama and his actions during his young presidency. However, it also discusses John F. Kennedy, George H. W. Bush, and the George W. Bush administration. 
The film claims that Obama has been carefully installed by powerful elite families, and that he is deliberately working against the best interests of the American people. It discusses and references main stream news pieces to suggest that elite families and multinational institutions utilize Obama in an effort to con the American people into accepting their globalist agenda, which according to Jones, would include items such as forced national service, warrantless wiretapping, FEMA camps, martial law, and a Bank of the World, which would dominate America through carbon taxes.
In July 2010, ''The Obama Deception'' was allegedly censored after a full-length version of the film was removed from YouTube where it had received over 6 million views. Alex Jones, the film's director, responded saying, "''The Obama Deception'' was getting more and more popular, and the establishment doesn   t like the fact that it exposes the Left-Right paradigm and identifies Obama as a puppet."
As of July 19 2010, the video was restored on Youtube, unadulterated, after attention was brought to it on Alex Jones' radio show and various websites.
