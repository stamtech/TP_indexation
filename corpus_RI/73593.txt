The CDP is a suburban planned community of about 4,000 homes, and one of Orange County's oldest and most expensive master planned communities.  The project began in 1968, when it was envisioned as a hunting lodge, now the Lodge at Coto de Caza, and the community was completed in 2003. For the 1984 Summer Olympics, the community served as host to the riding, running, shooting, and fencing portions of the modern pentathlon events. Around the town there are still undeveloped lots available for purchase.  Currently there are two 18-hole golf courses, and two club houses, one considered the "old club" and the other the "new club."  The new club, the Coto De Caza Golf & Racquet Club, harbors the facilities of the two golf courses and adjacent ten tennis courts.  The old club, located in the residential area known as "the Village," was once home to tennis guru and teacher Vic Braden.  The old club was also the home location for the Coto de Caza Youth Swim Team.  The new club finished construction of the new Spa & Sports Club building in April 2008 that houses a new fitness center with state of the art StarTrac exercise equipment, a spa with many services, a snack bar with Starbuck's coffee, and the Michael Chang tennis hall of fame and member lounge. The golf courses are both Robert Trent Jones Jr. design. The North course was rated the most difficult golf course in all of Orange County.
The community is the setting of the reality-based television show ''The Real Housewives of Orange County'' on Bravo.

While some residents believe that "Coto de Caza" means "Preserve of the Hunt" in Portuguese, this is erroneous. Actually, "Coto de Caza" is Spanish for "Hunt Reserve" and implies that the reserve is private.

An attempt to build a 400-student public school within the walls of the community was rebuffed by the residents. The residents had concerns that it would "undermine the privacy and security" of the enclave, that it would be "downright illegal ", that it would force admission of large numbers of non-residents to the community, and that an eventual lawsuit would force the removal of the gates. The reason for proposal was that Wagon Wheel Elementary School, which is located immediately outside the community gates, had far more students than planned. The school equipment was to consist of 20 portable buildings which would have simply been added to Wagon Wheel if the new school's construction could not be completed. Had it been built, it would have become the first public school to be built inside the limits of a gated community.
