By 2002, he picked up the newly released '' '' and garnered success by finishing second in the televised Ongamenet WarCraft Retail League before retiring.
He has turned his attention to professional poker the last few years. Grospellier is a member of Team PokerStars. He was the first person ever to reach "Supernova" and "Supernova Elite" statuses on PokerStars - having earned 100,000 player points in just 2 weeks and 1,000,000 player points in 4 and a half months, respectively.
He set the Guinness World Record for most Single Table Sit & Goes played in one hour for a total of 62 at a $6.50 buy in with a profit of $23.60.
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $6,100,000.
On Saturday, January 20, 2007 he finished second in the Copenhagen event on the European Poker Tour for 309,000 Euros.
In January 2008, Grospellier finished in 1st place winning $2,000,000 at the European Poker Tour's (EPT) PokerStars Caribbean Poker Adventure.
A year later, while being knocked out of the main event of the PokerStars Caribbean Poker Adventure on day 1, Grospellier went on to take home the EPT5 $25,000 buy-in "High Roller" side event for $433,500.
In October 2008, Grospellier added to his tournament haul by winning the World Poker Tour's Festa al Lago tournament, claiming a $1.4 million first prize.  The win marked Grospellier's first-ever cash on the WPT.  He also became just the third person, along with Roland De Wolfe and Gavin Griffin, to win a title on both the WPT and EPT. As a result of his success on the seventh season of the World Poker Tour, Grospellier was awarded the distinction of "WPT Player of the Year." 
Grospellier was disqualified from event 29 in the 2008 World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) for agreeing to go all-in blind with another player. This violated the tournament rule which states "Poker is an individual (not a team) game. Any action or chat intended to help another player is unethical and is prohibited." His winnings were forfeited and other places were moved up in the standings to replace his finish. Two other players (Annette_15 and charder30) had also violated the same rule earlier.
On September 18, 2009, Grospellier won his first WCOOP bracelet in event 38. He added a second bracelet only three days later in Event 43 by besting a field of 9,220 entrants. His winnings for both events totaled nearly $500,000.
Grospellier won his first WSOP bracelet in the '2011 Seven Card Stud Championship', overcoming a field of 126 to collect $331,639 in prize money. This win made Grospellier only the fourth player to win a WPT, EPT and WSOP title.
