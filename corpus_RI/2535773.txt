I think the main problem with the article is that it is very badly organized. Some aspects of Yahoo! receive very thorough coverage, while other important aspects of Yahoo! receive very little coverage in the article. 
For example, there is way too much information on the history of Yahoo! Besides the "History" section, there is a section on important events in Yahoo!'s history. The "Criticism" section should be near the end of the article, and it does not even mention the Yahoo! trolling phenomenon - which is instead mentioned in the wrong place - the "History" section! "Yahoo! Research Labs" should not be under the "Important Events" section. Then you see a tiny "Yahoo! Next" section - it could be merged with Yahoo! Research Labs to make a "Future of Yahoo!" section. 
Now, read the following two articles I wrote: Google Groups and Homerun. In the Google Groups article, the "Interface features" section is the most comprehensive. In the Homerun article, the "Plot" section is the most comprehensive. What about Yahoo!? If I read an article about a company, I would expect the most comprehensive section to be the one about the range of products or services the company sells or provides. The Yahoo! article, however, provides a long list of "Yahoo!-owned sites and services". Could you provide some prose, rather than a list?
If the organization/structure of the article is improved, I'll nominate it for Good Article.
I have expanded the new List_of_Yahoo!-owned_sites_and_services article. As I am not familiar with most Yahoo! services, I hope other editors can help expand the summaries I provided for Yahoo! services. In addition, the List_of_Yahoo!-owned_sites_and_services article needs to be renamed. Could anyone suggest a better name? Once we have a better name, I can make my changes to the Yahoo! article itself. --  15:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)
