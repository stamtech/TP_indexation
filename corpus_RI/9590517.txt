The book, approximately 600 pages, is based on interviews with many who were close to Obama, and with Obama himself.  It places Obama's career in the context of the American civil rights movement, Obama's family, and influential figures from the political establishment in Chicago, Illinois, covering Remnick's assessment of Obama's poise, charisma, negotiation skills, ambition, and political calculations made during his formative years.  It also describes Obama's efforts at self-creation, and of understanding his relationship with his estranged father. 
Patricia Williams, in ''The New York Times'', described the book as "studious and encyclopedic" while John R. MacArthur, writing in ''The Spectator'', accused Remnick of "mythmaking", saying the book has "all the tell-tale signs of an authorised biography".
