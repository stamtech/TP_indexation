The 266 replaced the former trolleybus route 666 between Edgware and Hammersmith in 1962. The Colindale and Edgware section was discontinued in 1970.
In 1976, the 266 was rerouted Mondays to Fridays except late evenings, and Saturdays except evenings, to the new Brent Cross Shopping Centre. The line was then extended from Colindale to Mill Hill Broadway, via Grahame Park and Montrose Avenue. 
The section between Staples Corner and Mill Hill Broadway section was withdrawn in 1981. 
The line was converted to one-person operation (opo) in 1985 using MCW Metrobuses operated by MTL London Northern. In 1996 the contract was handed over to Metroline and the Metrobuses were painted in Metroline livery. They were also supplemented by Volvo Olympians from the 52 Line. In late 1998 low-floor Tridents entered service. Not all the Metrobuses were painted in Metroline's livery, as the units were to be converted to Arriva London use. Volvo Olympians replaced the Metrobuses between 2001 and 2003. During this transion period, the odd single-decker working was not uncommon, with both Plaxton- and Marshall-bodied Darts sighted. Even Lances were used. In early 2005 the route was converted to low-floor operation using Alexander-bodied Tridents.
The 266 gained a night service (N266) in 2001 but only as far as Cricklewood Garage. Brent Cross Bus station was subsequently opened for 24-hour operation, and now the route runs there day and night. The 'N' prefix was dropped in 2004.
The route featured in an episode of Mr Bean Rides Again.
