Video logs (vlogs) also often take advantage of web syndication to allow for the distribution of video over the Internet using either the RSS or Atom syndication formats, for automatic aggregation and playback on mobile devices and personal computers (See video podcast).
In November 2000, Adrian Miles posted a video of changing text on a still image, coining the term ''vog'' to refer to his video blog.|archivedate=2004-01-08|accessdate=2010-06-03}}{{Cite web|url=http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/vog/12.2000/27.11.00.html|title=vog|last=Miles|first=Adrian|date=2000-11-27|archiveurl={{wayback|url=http://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/vog/12.2000/27.11.00.html|date=20010723205211}}|archivedate=2001-07-23|accessdate=2010-06-03}} In 2004, Steve Garfield launched his own video blog and declared that year "the year of the video blog".              {{cite web | url = http://stevegarfield.blogs.com/videoblog/2004/01/index.html | title = 2004: The Year of the Video Blog | accessdate = 2011-04-25 | last = Garfield | first = Steve | date = 2004-01-01 | work = Steve Garfield's VIdeo Blog | publisher = Steve Garfield | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yDB54ARH | archivedate = 2011-04-25}} In an effort to fulfill this prediction, Miles and Garfield soon joined their online colleagues Jay Dedman, Peter Van Dijck, Andreas Haugstrup Pedersen, and Christophe Bouten in creating a group on Yahoo! Groups devoted to video blogging.{{Cite web|url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/videoblogging/messages/1|title=Yahoo! Groups: Videoblogging|publisher=Yahoo!

Vlogging saw a remarkable increase in popularity beginning in 2005. The Yahoo! Videoblogging Group saw its membership increase dramatically in 2005. The most popular video sharing site to date, YouTube, was founded in February 2005. Many open sources content management systems enable users to post  videos content allowing bloggers to access  and administer their own video blogging sites. Moreover, convergence of mobile phones with digital cameras allow the publication  of videos contents on  the Web almost as it is recorded.
Radio Stations and television stations are now using video blogging as a way to help interact more with listeners and viewers.
