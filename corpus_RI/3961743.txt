A number of different limited series have been published under the ''Strange Killings'' banner, all of which centered around British 'combat magician' William Gravel. Most recently these series were republished under the Gravel name, followed by the launch of a new series, ''Gravel''.
Gravel initially appeared in the ''Strange Kiss'' limited series, which was followed by a sequel, ''Stranger Kisses''. The third series was titled ''Strange Killings'', which remained the name for the subsequent limited series, until the latest ongoing series called ''Gravel''. With ''Gravel'', Wolfer became the co-author with Raulo Caceres joining as the first of what has been described as a "revolving team" of artists.
The series have been collected into their own trade paperbacks but there is also a signed limited edition hardcover which collects the older series in one volume:
A movie adaptation is planned by Legendary Pictures, with Rick Alexander penciled in as producer and Warren Ellis writing the first draft as well as being executive producer.
