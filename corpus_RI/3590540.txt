Can anyone point me in the direction of a book that would have grammatical rules that includes not starting a paragraph with a conjunction? Thanks.    The preceding   comment was added by   (       ).
Is it a "cellular phone" or a "cell phone"?
Can contractions be used in these circumstance: (they just don't sound right)
I've cows in my barn. (I have cows in my barn)
Btw, what in the world is "ietnus" supposed to mean?   22:20, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
Okay then. "Ietnus" means nothing, I just couldn't think of a subject. Another example: "I've a joke for thee." Still, I suppose it doesn't sound too bad.--   06:12, 28 December 2006 (UTC)
The whole question of asking a stranger the time is sexually loaded.  I'm not suggesting that every time you get asked the time you're being propositioned, but it is a very common approach, and the form of the language used is relatively unimportant to the unspoken message.  On the phones question, "mobile phone" or just "mobile" is the usual usage in Australia, but I was recently asked my "cell phone number" by a car rental dude, and we all understand what the term means.    01:15, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
Hello, I'm wondering what language is this in my school song. Originally it's written in Thai language but no meaning at all in Thai. Below is the transcription of the song. Chulalongkorn is my school name.
Thank you --  23:54, 22 December 2006 (UTC)
