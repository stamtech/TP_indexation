I know it's "just a movie", but I'm still curious: in ''"Crocodile" Dundee II'', Dundee jumps off a building, holding a rope, and about five or six stories down, the rope snaps taught, and he swings right through a window. Assuming the rope could never break, would this stunt even be remotely possible, without ripping skin off one's hand, etc.?     Ker  uno  copia     08:32, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
Great answers, thank you everyone! I'm not sure how to suggest anything to Mythbusters, but it could make a neat segment.     Ker  uno  copia     02:31, 29 December 2010 (UTC)
I couldn't find an answer in the archives. But with my limited knowledge of science, with all the people being born and gaining mass throughout the centuries, shouldn't the earth be gaining mass? Or is the earth losing energy to each living person? I ask, because in the movie ''Houseboat'', Cary Grant explains death to his son in terms of a pitcher of water that is poured back into the earth. I understood where the death of a person becomes the earth, but I don't understand where the mass of a born person comes from.     Ker  uno  copia     08:42, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
Thanks everyone for your responses, this is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't realize I was essentially asking "Where does the mass of a tree come from?" but I sort of had to wonder about the ethereal part of the human soul, but no one mentioned it (or if billions of souls would even register against billions of human bodies). Still, I think this is all fascinating, thank you! - Ker  uno  copia     02:30, 29 December 2010 (UTC)
So now it turns out both the British  and Australians are getting fat too. It has by no means been limited to the US, premature reports aside. In the US, it's fashionable to blame it on high fructose corn syrup, but I haven't a clue if that (uneconomical but for poor legislation) concoction is even available in Britain or Australia. It's clearly something to do with lifestyle or wealth. What in the world could be the cause of all this?   ( ) 11:25, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
McDonald's, Subway, Aldi, Burger King, Monosodium glutamate... Always read the criticisms sections. It is ddefinately not only high fructose corn syrup (although I haven't read the article)      Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 11:51, 27 December 2010 (UTC) --  ( ) 11:52, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
With all due respect to everyone, only a few have you have directly addressed what is different ''now'' than what existed ''20 years ago''. Of course eating fast food can make someone fat, but that was true back then too. And as for the argument for the internet: I find it entirely unconvincing: there were Nintendos and television back then too. And not ''that'' many people spend all day in lounging in front of the internet that wouldn't have lounged before.   ( ) 21:21, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
And yet again, sandman, that doesn't address what's different now than what was 20 years ago. Nor does this anecdotal story explain why countries other than the US are getting fat at comparable levels.   ( )
That is an interesting point. I hadn't thought of it. And yet, when I look at pictures of my parents 20-30 years ago, it's clear that everyone was skinnier back then. I can't possibly see how a little extra work could cause that, unless for some reason the lack of sleep is can affect weight (which I know it's done to me in the past, interestingly). Several friends and I noticed recently when we had to quit work, that we all lost several pounds, yet none of us thought we ate too much in our sedentary job.   ( ) 08:28, 30 December 2010 (UTC)

Hi. I have questions about the following methodologies common in science:
Thanks. ~   (   ) 17:30, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
Climate science is at least as complicated as knowing how every detail of every component of a car works. Someone who can start the car and turn the sterring wheel is a long way from this level of understanding.   ( ) 22:10, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
There is no doubt that cell phones can do things that traditional landline phones cannot.   Don't get me wrong, I like my cellphone (though sometimes I worry that it gives me cancer in my private parts, but that is another question entriely).
But here's the thing.... before cell phones were invented, regular phones used to work great.  You could hear the person on the other line, the call would stay connected until one of you hung up, you could go deep underground and as long as there was a phone down there, you could still hear the other person.
How far away are we from cell phones being equally reliable?--  ( ) 19:12, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
I had a plain old wax candle burning cleanly and emitting virtually no visible smoke and then when I blew it out there was quite a bit. In general at a layman's level, why was there virtually no smoke during the burning and why did smoking start as the flame died? Is it because the matter that would have become visible smoke was fully reacted into an invisible product while the flame was providing energy to do so?   Thanks.   ( ) 20:45, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
Why is a meter the distance travelled by light in 299,792,458^-1 seconds? Why didn't they just make it a clean 300,000,000? Why did they pick that value at all?     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 22:54, 27 December 2010 (UTC)
