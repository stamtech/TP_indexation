Mitchell was educated at St Patrick's College, Shorncliffe and played his junior rugby for a Pine Rivers club, going on to play rugby for University. Mitchell went on to captain the Queensland Academy of Sport U-19 team as well as going on to be an Australian Schoolboy and Sevens international.
Mitchell made his international debut for the Wallabies against South Africa in 2005, after being selected after an amazing season with the Queensland Reds where he scored 11 tries and was named Australia's rookie of the year. 
His international career stalled after Australia's autumn international tour in 2005, and he didn't feature for the Wallabies again until Wales visited in 2007. By this time Mitchell had switched to newly formed Western Force and impressed enough to gain a place in the Australia squad for the 2007 World Cup in France. He scored 7 tries during that tournament and re-established himself on the international stage. 
Mitchell's domestic future again had a period of speculation when he was approached by the NSW Waratahs and the ACT Brumbies ahead of the 2010 Super 14. Mitchell eventually signed for the NSW Waratahs, replacing Sam Norton-Knight, signing for a payment of $700,000 per season with a win bonus of $1600 per game.
Mitchell dislocated his ankle and broke a bone in his leg after he collided with Scott Higginbotham of the Reds during their match on Saturday, 23 April and has been ruled out of the World Cup that will be held in New Zealand during September to October of this year.
