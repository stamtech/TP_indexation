  The collision resulted in the death of the operator of the rear train, '''Terrese Edmonds''', and the injuries of numerous others. Fourteen passengers were taken to area hospitals, one of whom was airlifted. 
A 19-year-old University of Phoenix student and Boston Red Sox intern is credited with saving lives. He had been on his way home from Fenway Park via the train when the crash occurred.
Initially, error was blamed for the crash. Later, the crash was blamed on Edmonds, who allegedly was using a cell phone while operating the train. After the NTSB investigated the accident it was found that cell phone use and/or distraction was not the cause of the accident, but an episode of micro-sleep caused by sleep apnea was likely the reason for the operator losing awareness of her environment. Edmonds was a relatively inexperienced operator who had tried for several years to get the job and was happy to have received it. The qualifications for the job included a high school diploma, a valid driver's license, a background check, and seven weeks of training.. 
Cell phone records indicated that Edmonds was not using her cell phone at the time of the incident. NTSB investigators also found that the brakes had not been applied, and the tracks were not faulty.
In 2009, the NTSB released its final report on the crash. About a year later, another crash on the same route was blamed on an operator texting while driving..
