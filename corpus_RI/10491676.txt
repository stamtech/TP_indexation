In the Spring of 2007, the video for the album's single "Broken Like This" placed in the Top 10 of the Universal Music Canada & Yahoo! Canada Up Your Music video contest.
The song "Resistance" was featured on ''HOPE Volume One'', a compilation CD with proceeds benefiting Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE). The album also features songs by Lisa Loeb, Charlotte Martin, Ken Andrews, Joanne Cash with Johnny Cash among others.
The CD album was hand packaged in circular aluminum tins reminiscent of old cinema reel canisters, symbolic for the bands' cinematic sound and also for the conceptual approach to infinite cycles as they are influenced by the heavenly orbs of the sun and moon.  The lid of the tin displays an ambigram of the title "Circadian," further emphasizing the predominant themes of unity and balance.  Reinforcing these themes, the lyrics and liner notes are also bound in a circular booklet depicting a clear glossed  graphic interpretation of an eclipse on the front and back covers.  The CD album face is silkscreened in an homage to the vinyl 45s that were instrumental in leading each member to fall in love with music as young children, and complete the cycle by becoming the music maker later in their lives.
In the Spring of 2007, Broken Like This was entered in the Universal Music Canada & Yahoo! Canada Up Your music video contest where it placed in the Top 10.
