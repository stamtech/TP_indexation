The translation technology for Babel Fish is provided by SYSTRAN, whose technology also powers a number of other sites and portals. It translates among English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish, and Spanish. 
Developed by AltaVista, the application is named after the fictional animal used for instantaneous language translation in Douglas Adams's series ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'' The fish name is a reference to the biblical account of the city of Babel and the various languages said to have arisen there.
After a long existence at babelfish.altavista.com, the site was moved on May 9, 2008 to babelfish.yahoo.com.
