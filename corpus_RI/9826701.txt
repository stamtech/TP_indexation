Jaka often says it was during this time that he developed the competitive spirit and mental fortitude that would help him in his poker career.
Jaka began his poker career playing online and in small live games during his freshman year at the University of Illinois at Urbana   Champaign.  Early on, with little knowledge of the game, Jaka had a habit of playing any two suited hole cards with the intent to draw to a flush.  His frequent use of this play quickly earned him the nickname "The Toilet".  Jaka embraced the tag, adopting it as his online alias, and the moniker has stuck ever since.Tapscott, Craig. , ''www.cardplayer.com'', May 14, 2009.
Jaka found early success in high-stake online cash games, soon building his bankroll to more than $170,000.  But as he began playing beyond his means, he was challenging the odds, and probability caught up with him.
After some soul searching, Jaka bounced back, switching up his approach and opting to play low buy-in tournaments and sit-and-gos rather than cash games.  Today, Jaka credits his decision to focus on studying tournament strategy as essential to his success.
