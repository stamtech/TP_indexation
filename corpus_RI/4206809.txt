Key goals of the program are to demonstrate the possibilities for solar power, smart meters, energy conservation, new approaches to electricity pricing and sustainable living in urban locations. It is a partnership approach that involves all levels of Government, the private sector and the local community. Consumers will be able to purchase solar photovoltaic panels using discounted loans. The project also plans to help low-income and rental households in the community share in the benefits of the project through other cost-saving initiatives. The Solar City project aims for customers to better understand energy use, electricity companies to understand the extent of cost savings in servicing peak demand periods, to provide a low risk environment to test new sustainable energy options, and for Governments to develop future energy and green house emission policies (Alice Solar City Energy Champions 2008, p.&nbsp;1).	Their vision is to create a model of cooperation between governments, businesses, and the community to achieve a community conscious of its unique environment and natural resources (Alice Solar City, 2008 p.&nbsp;2).  The program emphasizes the importance of being energy efficient as the first priority, followed by utilizing renewable energy sources (Alice Solar City Energy Champions 2008, p.&nbsp;3).
The areas of the City of Salisbury, City of Tea Tree Gully and City of Playford and Adelaide City Council part of the Adelaide Solar City. Adelaide has peak electricity supply problems, higher average domestic electricity prices than other States and a large amount of sunshine each year.
Energy options being trialled through the Adelaide Solar City include:
Some proposed features of the project include:
A AUD1.54 million project to build Australia's largest roof mounted solar power system on the roof of the Alice Crowne Plaza was announced on 1 October 2008.
Alice Solar City has been operating a little over 1.5 years. To date on 17 March 2009,  610 householders and 32 businesses had registered with Alice Solar City; 520 home energy surveys had been completed, and $1.5 million in financial incentives for energy efficient measures had been issued. Over 40 solar PV and 100 solar hot water systems had been installed (Centralian Advocate 2009e, p.&nbsp;23).   The completed solar technology installations are estimated to save  400,000 kWh per year, which equates to the average energy consumption of about 50 Alice Springs homes (Boon 2009, p.&nbsp;4).
Reduction in Energy Demand : 5,352&nbsp;kW
Reduction in annual Energy Consumption:	10,667 MWh/year (Electricity) + 5,233 GJ/year (gas)
Estimated Reduction in CO2 emissions:	8,683 tonnes/year (Electricity) + 4,259 tonnes/year (gas)
Equivalent cars removed per year: 3,266
Equivalent number of all cars in Alice Springs removed per year: 22%
The lead organisation for this project is BP Solar. This project includes efficiency audit trials, 3,500 energy efficiency consultations installation of solar water heaters and photovoltaic panel installation that supplies one megawatt of solar energy, amongst other measures.
The Central Victoria Solar City was announced on 10 December 2008.It covers one fifth of Victoria and involves 14 municipalities. Locals of Ballarat and Bendigo will be able to support solar power without having a photovoltaic system on their roof, as two large solar parks, each generating 300&nbsp;kW, will be built near those cities.
The Coburg Solar City was announced on 10 June 2008. Low income households are intended to be a focus of the program.
Under Stage 1 of the Perth Solar City project it is proposed to:
Ergon Energy is the leader of the consortium initiating the 2007 to 2013 project. The project involved free energy audits, installation of smart meters and solar photovoltaic systems installed in selected homes and public buildings.
