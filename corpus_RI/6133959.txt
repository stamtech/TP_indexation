The Cedar Grove Ruritan Club (CGRC), established June 1951, is one of the hubs of the Cedar Grove community.  Various groups use the club baseball field, gym, grounds, walking track, and building year round.  The site is host for multiple events that support the people of Cedar Grove and surrounding communities.  The club sponsors the Hummingbird 4H Club and other youth oriented groups.  The CGRC was recently awarded a plaque from the Orange County Schools Board of Education for recognition of service and dedication to the youth of Orange County, partly due to our recent support and hosting of the Orange County Schools    Teacher of the Year Award.  CGRC was sponsored by the Oak Grove Ruritan Club and in 1981 the CGRC sponsored the Efland Ruritan Club.   The CGRC original location is now the Five Forks Church Community Building, the current location is the former building and grounds of Aycock School.
