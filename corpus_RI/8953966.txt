There have been several differing etymologies given for the surname. One view is that it is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic ''MacShuibhne'', which means "son of ''Suibhne''". The Gaelic name ''Suibhne'' is a byname, which means "pleasant". This Gaelic name was also used as a Gaelic equivalent of the Old Norse byname ''Sveinn'', which means "boy". Another view is that the Anglicised surname is derived from the Gaelic ''MacCuinn'', meaning "son of ''Conn''". The Gaelic personal name ''Conn'' is composed of an Old Celtic element meaning "chief". Another suggested origin of the Anglicised surname is from the Gaelic ''MacCuithein''. 
A similarly spelt surname, ''Macquien'', is considered to be often confused with, and wrongly represented by ''Macqueen''. This name is considered to be derived from the Gaelic personal name ''Aoidhean'' which means "little ''Aodh''". The Gaelic personal name ''Aodh'' is a modern form of ''Aed'', which means "fire". ''Macquien'' can be presented in Scottish Gaelic as ''MacAoidhein''; and in the north of Scotland as ''MacCuithein''. 
The surname have undergone changes over the years. ''Mackquean'' (1502); ''M'Queyn'' (1543); ''M'Queen'' (1609).
The Anglicised surnames can be represented in Scottish Gaelic several different ways. ''MacCuinn'' is the form for the surname of Galloway. ''MacCuithein'' is the form for the surname in the north of Scotland;  and ''MacShuibhne'' is the form in the south of Scotland.
