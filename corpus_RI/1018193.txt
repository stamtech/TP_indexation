Malcolm King (Anderson) is a wealthy, selfish, obnoxious businessman who is about to divorce his wife Renee (Smith). She plans to ruin him financially during the court proceedings, and King is willing to do anything to protect his fortune.
He enlists his mistress, Peaches (Hall), and her brother, Herb (Murphy), to stage a mock kidnapping. They are to make and receive a huge ransom demand, which would keep the money safe from his wife. 
Unfortunately for him, two other people have similar plans to kidnap him; Angela (Parker), an aggrieved employee and Corey (Mohr), who lives in his grandmother's basement and needs $10,000 after being threatened by his adopted sister.

Users, a D. Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film 4th in the 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s, with a rating of 0%.
