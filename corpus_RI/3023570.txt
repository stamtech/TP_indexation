Mitchell added the British super-featherweight title to his Commonwealth belt when he stopped Carl Johanneson in the ninth round of his fight on 9 March 2008. The fight was on the undercard of David Hayes World Cruiserweight championship win over Enzo Macarrinelli and was a barnstormer. Mitchell was 26-0 and British and Commonwealth champion. On 7 June 2008 Mitchell beat Walter Estrada in Atlantic City, New Jersey on the undercard of Kelly Pavlik's middleweight title fight with Gary Lockett in a fifth round TKO. Mitchell continued chopping Estrada down, until a right hand followed by a left to the body sank Estrada in the closing seconds of the round. When Estrada got up, the referee took a long look before waving it off to extend Mitchell's unbeaten record to 27-0. After this fight Mitchell was out of action for just under a year with a hand injury, putting his world title ambitions on hold. His return on 22 May 2009 was a comfortable third round stoppage win over little known Lanquaye Wilson. Two months later on the Khan vs Kotelnik undercard Mitchell recorded an eighth-round win over Rudy Encarncion.
Mitchell fought Amir Khan's conqueror Breidis Prescott, on the Khan vs Salita undercard on 5 December 2009 in Newcastle, winning by unanimous decision and producing a performance that many didn't believe him capable of. Kevin fought at Wembley Arena just two months later, impressively knocking out Ignacio Mendoza in two rounds appearing to be a tune up fight. This ultimately proved to be the case as promoter Frank Warren revealed that he would challenge Australian interim WBO Lightweight World Champion Michael Katsidis at Boleyn Ground on 15 May 2010. Full time WBO champion Juan Manuel Marquez is expected to vacate, promoting the fight to a full world title bout. The fight was billed as 'Hammer Time', due to Mitchell's West Ham roots.  Mitchell was stopped in the third round after Katsidis hit him with two huge lefts.
