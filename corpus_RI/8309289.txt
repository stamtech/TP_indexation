The last assembly election took place in April 2011, which resulted in AIADMK and its allies winning. The next election should take place around May 2016. The election can take place much earlier if the current alliance loses the vote of confidence, or if parties in the ruling alliance leaves, which results in President's rule and fresh elections will be held. Since AIADMK got a majority on its own, it is expected that they will complete the full term. 
The state of Tamil Nadu had its beginnings in the Madras Presidency which was created in 1685. Initially, the Presidency was administered by a President who was advised by an Executive Council in the administration of the province. A legislative council came into being in 1861 by the Indian Councils Act 1861. The members of the council were nominated. In November 1920, by the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms,  the existing structure of the legislative council was modified by the addition of elected members and the first elections were held in December 1920. From 1920 till India's independence in 1947, with the exception of the Second World War period, regular elections were held on a three-year basis. Initially, the electorate was limited to zamindars, district board chairmans and influential people. In 1935, the electorate was enlarged by the Government of India Act, 1935.  In 1952, the electorate was finally large enough to cover all legal citizens of the province over the age of 18.
The Justice Party won a majority in the assembly in the 1920, 1923 and 1930 elections. It formed a minority government in the 1934 elections and lost in the 1926, 1937 and 1946 elections. The assembly was dissolved in 1939 when the Congress ministry of C. Rajagopalachari resigned and no elections were held in 1940 and 1943. The Swaraj Party won majorities in the 1926 and the 1934 elections but did not form the government. It did not contest the 1920 elections and contested and won as a part of the Indian National Congress in 1937.
The Madras state was created in 1950 when India became a republic. In 1968, the name of Madras state was changed to Tamil Nadu.
