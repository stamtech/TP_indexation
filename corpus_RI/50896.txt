On July 21, 1821, there were two counties that formed Florida:  Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east.  In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County became Mosquito County, and Enterprise was named the County Seat.  This large county was renamed Orange County in 1845 when Florida became a state.  For the next 70 years, Orange County would split into numerous other counties.  Seminole County was one of the last counties to emerge from Orange County.
Seminole County was created on April 25, 1913 out of part of the northern portion of Orange County by the Florida Legislature. It was named for the Seminole tribe of Indians. The name "Seminole" is thought to be derived from the Spanish word ''cimarron,'' meaning "wild" or "runaway."
The government currently operates under a County Charter originally adopted in 1989 and amended in November, 1994. Policymaking and the legislative authority are vested in the Board of County Commissioners, a five-member board elected to four-year terms in partisan, countywide elections and from single member districts. The Board adopts the County budget, levies property taxes and other fees, and hires the County Manager and County Attorney. In addition to the Board there are five Constitutional Officers who are elected to partisan, four-year terms in accordance with the constitution of the State of Florida.
The Constitutional Officers, Clerk of the Circuit and County Courts, Sheriff, Tax Collector, Property Appraiser, and Supervisor of Elections, maintain separate accounting records and budgets. The Board funds a portion or, in certain instances, all of the operating budgets of the County's Constitutional Officers.
The County provides a full range of services; the construction and maintenance of the County's infrastructure, public safety, recreation, health and human services, and development and protection of the physical and economic environment.
In addition to the County Government described above, there are other political entities which are controlled by the County, but have their own appointed boards; the Seminole County Expressway Authority, the Seminole County Port Authority, the Fred R. Wilson Memorial Law Library and the US 17-92 Community Redevelopment Agency

Seminole County's location between Volusia County and Orange County has made it one of the fastest growing counties in Florida.
