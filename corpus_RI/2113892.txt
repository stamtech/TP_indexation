The '''Stanford Solar Car Project''' is a student group at Stanford University which builds, tests, and races solar powered vehicles.  A student-run, donation-funded organization, SSCP has been building and racing solar-powered vehicles since 1986. The team's most recent car, Apogee, placed 14th in its class and 1924th overall in the recent Global Green Challenge in Australia. The team's most successful vehicle, Solstice, placed first in the stock class of the 2005 North American Solar Challenge, a 2,500 mile race from Austin, Texas (USA) to Calgary, Alberta (Canada). 
The Stanford Solar Car Project has historically prided itself on being a completely student-run project.  There is no faculty involvement at a managerial or technical level; faculty involvement is limited to advocacy and fundraising.
The project is open to Stanford students in all fields of study and seeks to educate groups on and off campus about applied engineering and renewable energy.  Official meetings occur on Monday nights and Saturday afternoons at the on-campus "Solar Car Site," a building shared with the Stanford DARPA Grand Challenge team.  However, work on the car continues at all times during the week, especially in the weeks and months leading up to a race.
The group is now in the process of designing and building its tenth vehicle for competition in the 2011 Global Green Challenge.  Their next car will be have vastly improved aerodynamics, more powerful solar panels, a more robust electrical system, and various other improvements.
