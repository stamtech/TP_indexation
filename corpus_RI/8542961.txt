Gaubert has developed a reputation as one of the best online players in the world.  In 2007, he chopped the Sunday Million tournament on PokerStars for $233,152.  The same day, he finished second in the Sunday Mulligan (a supplemental tournament to the larger and more heavily advertised Sunday Million) for $178,000. On November 2, 2008 he won a rebuy tournament on Full Tilt Poker for $61,837.50.  On January 25, 2009 he won the prestigious $55 rebuy tournament on PokerStars for $31,593.75. He again won the Sunday Mulligan on April 26, 2009, this time cashing for $52,695. His total online tournament winnings are estimated by Cardplayer at over $1.3 million. 
The 2008 World Series of Poker saw Gaubert make his first deep run in the Main Event. He finished 58th out of 6,844 participants for a $115,800 payday.  Rather than using his clothing as advertising space for sponsors, he delighted his friends and fans by wearing a bright yellow "LSU" cap throughout his main event run.
Gaubert claimed his first major live tournament victory with the 2009 World Poker Open in Robinsonville, Mississippi. He defeated a final table that included 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event winner Chris Moneymaker and noted professional poker player Chad Brown. In the final hand, Gaubert's pocket aces held up to beat his opponent's top pair of tens to win the tournament and $192,953.
