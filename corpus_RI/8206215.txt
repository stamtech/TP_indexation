I'm looking for the ideal free undelete software that runs under Windows Vista 64-bit.  (I tried searching the refdesk; I would have assumed this is a FAQ; but unfortunately searching for "undelete" seems to come up with a billion entries which do not mention the word "undelete", because it seems to be a keyword embedded somehow in the archives.)

Is there anything instrinsic to the x86 (or'x64') ISA that prevents an asynchronous version of the processor being made?  ( ) 12:10, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
Is there a list where the next places in the UK that will be on streetview will be, i cant seem to find one... 
When buying from online retailers in the UK many ship from Jersey. I have read that there may be a tax avoidance reason for this. Previously I assumed that the goods were often cheaper due to the companies not requiring store frontage etc.
Question what is VAT on computer DVDs etc? How do I know if I have avoided paying tax? Can anyone explain the 'goods under   18' sometimes mentioned?
As this may drift into the legal domain can someone also tell me what goverment department I should contact for specific clarification. If anyone can explain the basics of what is going on though, I would appreciate it - (it's unclear to me if I have broken the law) Thanks.  ( ) 13:06, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

I got yahoo mail recently as I wanted a Flickr account and a yahoo ID always includes email. I am happy with my current email service and would therefore like to know if it is possible to redirect yahoo to my msn account! Thanks. --  ( ) 20:16, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
You can set a re-direct on your yahoo mail so that it goes to a Yahoo account (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060812082947AAsNu6h) gives you details of how to achieve this. That way anything that goes to it will get redirected to the address you specify (presumably your MSN account).   ( ) 21:02, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
 1min vs Octave 
Why does a power converter from 110V to 240V have a warning saying not for electronics that use above 25 watts even if the converter is rated from 0-2500 Watts? Is it safe to use with an electronic device (specifically iPods and digital cameras) that use over 25 watts, but less than 2500? Or can those use just an adapter as the products in question are all rated for a voltage of 100-240 despite saying recommended to be used in the US only?--  ( ) 22:55, 9 June 2009 (UTC)
