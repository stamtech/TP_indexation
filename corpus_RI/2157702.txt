The protocol was designed to provide for a secure way to automatically keep communicating new messages between a server and a mobile device like a PDA or Smartphone. It should reduce the time and effort needed to synchronize messages between the two by using an open connection that is kept alive by some kind of heartbeat. To reduce necessary bandwidth, it uses compression and command macros.
Additionally, P-IMAP features a mechanism for sending e-mail that is derived from (but not identical to) SMTP, and so a rich e-mail service is provided using a single connection.
P-IMAP should not be viewed as an alternative to the IMAP IDLE command (RFC 2177). In fact, IDLE is one of the required mechanisms for a P-IMAP server to notify the client (optional notifications are SMS or WAP Push).
Although they are both based on IMAP, the Yahoo Mail and MobileMe push email services for iPhone do not use a standard form of P-IMAP. Yahoo Mail uses a special SMS message to trigger an email synchronization, while Apple Inc.'s MobileMe uses a server within Apple that maintains a persistent IP connection to each iPhone.
