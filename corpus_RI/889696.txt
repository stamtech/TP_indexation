The executive mayor of the municipality is Bazil Petrus of the DA who won the post with the support of a multi-party coalition which consists of the DA, ACDP, VF+ and the ID. In the local government elections of March 2006, the DA took 17 seats, ANC 15 seats, ACDP 2 seats, ID 2 seats and one for the VF+. The George Local Municipality is one of the most stable in the Western Cape and was governed by the DA since the December 2000 local poll. The DA has withstood three floor crossing windows which had resulted in government changes in many other Western Cape municipalities (in fact the DA obtained an outright majority in the September 2002 floor-crossing, which went against the prevailing trend that saw the party lose control of most other Western Cape municipalities). Bazil Petrus was preceded by Marius Swart who became mayor in 2000 and resigned in 2004.
Prior to this the George Local Municipality was governed by the ANC since the November 2005 local government elections.
