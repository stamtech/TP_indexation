In partnership with ''Green Energy Ohio'' the museum hosted an exhibit on the use of solar power in African Villages. The museum installed a solar panel on its roof.  The components of the system are in a clear display case and part of the exhibit. The African Solar Village Outreach Project plans to establish creative avenues for teaching science and mathematics, specifically Solar Energy, to visitors.  The African Solar Village exhibit, its other tours and hands-on activities are designed to offer an understanding of how science and culture interrelate in unique ways.
