There are currently only three localizations of the service active in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan; Yahoo! has already discontinued the service in United States, Canada, Singapore, United Kingdom and Ireland. The US and Canada sections of the site were closed on June 16, 2007. The Singapore section of the site was closed on September 22, 2008. The UK and Ireland service was closed on June 28, 2002. During the shutdown of the UK and Ireland service, Yahoo! took the unusual step of endorsing its main auctions rival, eBay, as their 'preferred' service.
Yahoo! Auctions was preferred by some sellers for its no-fee policy     all revenue was from advertising. Singaporean users chose to shy away from eBay after the closure of Yahoo! Auctions in Singapore, citing high fees and a cluttered website.
In April 2001, Yahoo! acquired ''SOLD.com.au'', a major competitor to eBay in Australia. SOLD.com.au was previously owned by John Fairfax Holdings' online interactive arm, ''F2''. The site was given a new address within the yahoo.com domain. In August 2003, Yahoo! announced that the site would be shutting down and directed users to eBay.
