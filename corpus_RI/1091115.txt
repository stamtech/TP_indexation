Warren College is home to a large number of engineering students because its general education requirements are more lenient for students pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering. Coincidentally, Warren also has the largest student population, with well over 4,000 undergraduate students, comprising over one fifth of the college population.  In 2006, the college has added a new building dedicated to the study of Information Technology, called Calit2. Warren College's core writing course incorporates general college level writing for students over two quarters.
All of the residence halls for Warren College students are named after other judges that sat on the court with Warren during his term with the U.S. Supreme Court. Residence halls are located near the ecological reserve which is a canyon filled with eucalyptus trees and has hiking trails.
Residence Halls include:
Apartments for both first and second year students include:
There are also graduate student apartments available at the Warren Campus.
The writing program at Earl Warren College consists of a two-quarter sequence based on the model of argumentation developed by British philosopher Stephen Toulmin.
Warren College also operates Warren College Television (WCTV), the highest-rated campus television station for 3 years. WCTV previously stopped operating, but restarted back in the Fall Quarter of 2008.
The Warren College campus is also home to an enormous rock sculpture in the shape of a bear, titled "Bear", located on the engineering quad.
Reflecting Earl Warren's tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Warren College's official motto is "Toward a life in balance."
