Starting as a internet poker player he successfully made the transition to live poker, and broke Allen Cunningham's record as the youngest person ever to win a World Series of Poker title  in 2004, winning a $3,000 Pot Limit Texas hold'em event. Griffin lost that record the following World Series to Eric Froehlich. 
Other achievements include finishing 3rd in a World Series of Poker Circuit Event at Harrah's Rincon in San Diego and finishing 7th at the 2007 World Series of Poker Pot Limit Hold'em Championship at the Rio in Las Vegas.
In 2008 Griffin won the Borgata Winter Open, his first World Poker Tour title. With the win, he was the first player to have won a WSOP bracelet, an EPT event, and a WPT event.  Only three other players, Roland De Wolfe, Jake Cody, and Bertrand Grospellier, have won a title in each of these three tournaments since Griffin accomplished the feat.
As of 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceed $4,500,000. His 10 cashes at the WSOP account for $442,255 of those winnings.
Griffin has been active in raising awareness of breast cancer.  He won the EPT Monte Carlo with pink hair for this cause.  Griffin also walked in the September 2007 and September 2009 Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in Long Beach, California with teammates and fiancee Amy Roberts.  He credits much of his success to the support of his friends, family and fiancee.
Gavin married Amy Roberts in a ceremony in Anaheim, CA on July 31, 2010.
