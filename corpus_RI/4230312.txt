Route 267 began on 9 May 1962 between Hammersmith ''The Grove'' and Hampton Court in the trolleybus replacement program for trolleybus route 667.
It was withdrawn between Fulwell and Hampton Court and replaced by new route R68 in 1991 with extensions to Hampton Church for school journeys and to Hampton Court Palace from 9 May 1992 for summer Sundays. The school service stopped in 1998.
The route runs daily from Hammersmith Bus Station to Fulwell Bus Garage with the summer Sunday extension to Hampton Court Palace.
Route 267 has been stationed at Fulwell garage with mainly MCW Metrobuses, and also Alexander Royale-bodied Volvo Olympians, Northern Counties Palatine-bodied Olympians and even single deck Darts. The route was converted to low floor operation in 2001 and 2002 with Alexander-bodied Tridents and gained Wright Eclipse Gemini-bodied Volvo B7TLs in early 2003. From 2005 Scania OmniDekkas were used on the route however the Tridents still do regular runs.
Some Scania OmniCitys were bought in March 2008 to increase the daytime service interval from 12 minutes to 10 minutes.
