Consumer Cellular specializes in cell phone plans for seniors.  The company was most recently profiled in The Oregonian's Silicon Forest blog as #15 on a list of the largest 25 tech companies in northwest Oregon.  They are also an Inc 5000 company.  
In June, 2010, Consumer Cellular began offering a QWERTY keyboard phone, which John Marick described as being simple and easy to use, and therefore appropriate for the "mature market" customers. Previously, Consumer Cellular also brought Doro phones, a cellular phone designed for seniors, into its network.  The New York Times Gadgetwise blog mentioned Consumer Cellular's Doro phone as a good option for seniors on November 3, 2009.
In 2005, Consumer Cellular began a relationship with the AARP, making the company the first cell phone provider to market to retirees.  The partnership became exclusive in 2008.  As result of this partnership, more than 85% of Consumer Cellular's current customers are older than 50.  The plans are relatively simplistic compared to other carriers, and have been advocated by such senior publications as the Senior Journal. 
During the 2008 to 2009 recession period, Consumer Cellular has remained profitable, and has continued hiring.
In the Consumer Reports no-contract cell phone service rating (Winter 2010), Consumer Cellular's overall score was 87 out of 100. This was the top spot in a summary of six competing companies surveyed, in the "no-contract cell service" category.
