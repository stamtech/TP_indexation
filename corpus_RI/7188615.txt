Despite being a relatively unknown player before the tournament, Cozen managed to make the final table of the main event. He was short stacked throughout the final table but was able to outlast several top professionals at the final table, including 1990 world champion Mansour Matloubi and bracelet winner John Bonetti who had much larger chip stacks than he had. Cozen made it to heads-up play but was extremely short-stacked by this time and he was defeated by Jim Bechtel on the third hand of heads-up play. He won $420,000 for his second place finish.
Cozen has a total of three cashes in the WSOP Main Event: 2nd in 1993, 114th in 1995, and 200th in 2008.

He also won the $1,000 Ace to Five event at the Queens Poker Classic IV in 1994. Cozen's most recent tournament win was the $2,500 Pot Limit Omaha event at the Five Diamond Poker Classic in 2004, earning $105,000.
