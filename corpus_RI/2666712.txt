Between 1977 and 1980, Long was an assistant instructor and lecturer at Indiana University before being hired as an assistant professor at Valparaiso University, where she worked between 1981 and 1988.

With the appointment of Dan Coats to the Senate in 1988, Long was elected as a Democrat in a special election to fill the vacancy. Long Thompson's first election to Congress in 1989 made national headlines because Indiana's 4th congressional district was considered a safe Republican seat, once held by then Vice President Quayle.  Long Thompson, then known as Jill Long, easily won re-election in 1990 and 1992 despite being a top Republican target for defeat.  She ran for reelection in 1994 but lost to Mark Souder as one of many Democrats to lose a seat in Congress as part of a Republican sweep that brought the Republican Party into majority status for the first time since 1954.
In 1995, Long was appointed by President Bill Clinton as Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development at the United States Department of Agriculture, where she served until 2001 with the start of the George W. Bush administration.  As Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development, Long Thompson managed 7,000 employees and a $10 billion budget, which funded rural housing, cooperative, water/waste, and business programs. Among her accomplishments as Under Secretary were reforming the single-family loan program, helping create thousands of jobs in economically challenged communities, and improving the efficiency of the Department.
In 2002, she attempted a political comeback when she ran for the open congressional seat in the 2nd District, but lost 50%-46% to Chris Chocola.
Thompson formally announced her gubernatorial candidacy on July 10, 2007. On September 27, 2007, Emily's List endorsed her campaign.  By February 25, 2008, the campaign had announced the endorsements of several leading labor unions including United Steelworkers, United Transportation Union, Service Employees International Union, Communication Workers of America, and the Local #446 of Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees. She defeated Indianapolis architect Jim Schellinger in the May 6, 2008 Democratic primary by 13,000 votes or less than 1 percent.
She made reforming state government, accountability, and making larger investments in vocational education the focal points of her campaign. As a candidate, she proposed campaign finance laws to prohibit businesses that are working with, or soliciting work from, state or local governments from donating to political campaigns while they are under contract and for two years following the conclusion of their work, and include regulations for lobbyists to report all expenditures, including meals, made to state government employees.
In Thompson's bid for Indiana governor, polling showed her lagging far behind her opponent Mitch Daniels. On Election Night, Daniels was declared the winner and Thompson conceded the race.
Thompson's margin of loss of 40.1% to Daniels's 57.8% was the largest in an Indiana Gubernatorial election since 1992.

The nomination was pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate when Obama installed Thompson on the board by recess appointment on March 27, 2010.  The Senate finally confirmed her outright to the Farm Credit Administration on September 16, 2010.
