The domain ''wretch.cc'' attracted at least 4 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.
In July 2007, Yahoo! acquired Wretch; this became the biggest acquisition of Yahoo in Taiwan since Kimo, which was the major stepping stone to Yahoo's success in Taiwan's market. Shortly after the transaction, an angry wave of users have reacted in complaints to the changes in terms of conditions.
Wretch.cc has been blocked by the internet censorship in the People's Republic of China since August 2007.
