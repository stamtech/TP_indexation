At a young age, it was apparent that Nejad should be in the broadcasting business, as he was a happy-go-lucky kid who never failed to entertain his family and friends with his personality and sense of humor.
Nejad hosted a show and reported for a local NBC affiliate while still in high school.  Nejad dropped out of Berkeley to pursue playing poker full-time. He worked as a dealer and prop player before becoming a successful high limit player. But despite his success in the poker world, Nejad still had the broadcasting itch. In 2002 he hosted an MTV pilot that was not picked up.
In 2003, at the PartyPoker Million Tournament, he met Mori Eskandani, then the Tournament Director of Poker Superstars and future producer for the National Heads-Up Poker Championship and Poker After Dark.  Eskandani hired Nejad as the Master of Ceremonies for the Poker Superstars event in 2004. In the February 7, 2008 episode of Poker Road Radio, Joe Sebok announced that Ali was the host of Poker Road Radio. His tenure began at the WPT Commerce event starting on February 26, 2008. His tenure ended right before the start of the 2009 WSOP.
Nejad is one of the poker players who believes he was a victim of the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal.
