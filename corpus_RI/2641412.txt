Bluetooth uses short-range radio waves over distances of 9 metres. For example, Bluetooth devices such as a keyboard, PDA, cell phone, mouse or computer can connect to each other wirelessly and the distance can be up to 10 meters (33 feet). Some of the Bluetooth devices can support headsets and printers.
