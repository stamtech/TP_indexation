SR 423 and its southern components serve as an alternate to the parallel Orange Blossom Trail.  The road is named after John Young, an astronaut from the Orlando area.
SR 423 begins at an interchange with SR 408 and heads north towards Orange Blossom Trail.  It then changes names to Lee Road east of Orange Blossom Trail to its terminus at U.S. Route 17/92 just east of Interstate 4.
South of State Road 423's southern terminus, John Young Parkway, known as Orange County Road 423 continues south towards I-4, the Beachline Expressway and the Southern Connector.  South of the Osceola-Orange county line, it is signed as Osceola County Road 531A and continues to a diamond intersection with the Osceola Parkway, ending a bit north of Pleasant Hill Road near Kissimmee, where the name changes to Orange Blossom Trail heading towards Campbell and to the Osceola-Polk county line.  The section from US 192 southward is also numbered US 17-92.
The first section of SR 423 was built by the Florida Department of Transportation in the early 1970s, from Colonial Drive (SR 50) west of downtown Orlando north to Orange Blossom Trail (US 441-SR 500).  Over the years, extensions to the south have been built, some by Orange County and some by the state.  
An additional extension is planned which will bring John Young Parkway northward from Orange Blossom Trail in Orlando to meet the west end of SR 434.
The entire route is located in Orlando, Orange County.
