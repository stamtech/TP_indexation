The game is played with ten people: "Pac-Man" and his "controller" (who keeps contact with him via cell phone and keeps track of how much of the city he has covered), and the four ghosts and their controllers.  Pac-Man and the Ghosts play out the game on the streets of Manhattan while their respective controllers give them information and strategy advice via cell-phone from the control room.
If the person touches a street sign at a street intersection, it is counted as a power pellet, and the "Pac-Man" can chase down the ghosts.
Pac-Man and his controller have an intelligence advantage as a result of Pac-Man's controller having a  bird's eye view of the game.  Pac-Man's controller can see the current position of all the Ghosts on the streets, although the Ghosts' controllers cannot see the current position of Pac-Man, only that of the other Ghosts.  Thus the Ghosts' numerical advantage is balanced against Pac-Man's information advantage.
