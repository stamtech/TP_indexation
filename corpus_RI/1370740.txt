In November 2009 Gary finished in 4th place in FTOPS event #22, the two day event. He won $193,462 for his efforts, his biggest online cash to date. He has also won $27,000 in the World Championship of Online Poker.
He has chosen not to attend any live poker event where he has to fly for environmental reasons. This includes the World Series of Poker. For a similar reason he has dyed his hair green for the World Series of Poker Europe 2007 where he was called 'The Al Gore of Poker'.
