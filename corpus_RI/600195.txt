The current pseudo-English name was made official in 2002. It had been in use as the domain name for the institute's homepage, swisstopo.ch, since 1997.
The main class of products produced by Swisstopo are topographical maps on seven different scales. Swiss maps have been praised for their accuracy and quality.
The numbering system of Swiss regular maps (apart from composites) is directly based on the geographical situation. A map number is always one higher than the map number of the adjacent map to the west, and one lower than the adjacent map to the east. From north to south, the numbers differ by 20 for the scale 1:25.000, 10 for the scale 1:50.000 and 5 for the scale 1:100.000. However, as can be seen on the , there are some exceptions to this rule: Switzerland is a little bit too large to be only 20 1:25.000 maps wide. Instead of choosing another system, the map to the east of ''1199 Scuol'' is called ''1199bis Piz Lad''. The same is true for some maps at scale 1:50.000.
In 1865, Herman Siegfried becomes the Chief of the Topographical Bureau, and the bureau moves from Geneva to Bern. Over the next few years, a composite map is published of Ticino, soundings start to measure the depth of the major Swiss lakes, and a first map is published scaled 1:250.000. In 1868, a Federal Act is passed to enforce the continuation of the initial topographic surveys, as well as the publication of the results. This results in new topographical surveys in 1869 and the publication of the first 13 ''Siegfriedkarten'' (1:25.000 and 1:50.000) in 1870. In 1878, a 1:1.000.000 map is published, and the next year, the height of the Pierre du Niton is measured to be 376.86 metre. In 1880, Herman Siegfried is succeeded by Jules Dumur.
In 1895, the Topographical surveys for the ''Siegfriedkarten'' are finished. As of 1901, 581 sheets of the ''Siegfriedkarten'' have been published, with only a few individual more maps to come (there would be 604 maps in 1926). On old maps of the modern series, a reference to those maps can still be found: until the seventies of the 20th century, the ''Siegfriedkarte'' was the best scale available for some areas of Switzerland, and therefore used by climbers and other alpinists. The printing of the ''Siegfriedkarten'' would continue until 1952.
In 1887, the first maps with relief shading are published. In 1889, a photographic studio is appended to the bureau. In the years after 1894, a wall-map for schools is published, in response to a request from the parliament to do so. In 1898, the soundings of the major Swiss lakes are finished. In 1901, the bureau is moved into an independent division within the military, and the name ''Eidgenossische Landestopographie'' becomes customary, a name still used by some people until today, and a name which can be found on some older maps. Hermann Kummerly publishes a relief wall-map for schools in the same year. In 1908, map trials are started to serve as a replacement for the ''Dufourkarten''. Two years later, trials start to replace the ''Siegfriedkarten''. Much of this military work would remain secret for many years. In 1913, 1922 and 1924, trials are done with aerial photogrammetry, first with balloons and later with aircraft, but only as of 1930 this is used for production of maps, and in 1940 terrestrial photogrammetry is abandoned.
On 21 June 1935, a  (German only) is passed on the production of the new National Map series. This is the start of the modern maps, ranging from 1:25.000 to 1:1.000.000 (see above). Because of the political situation in Europe, work is started on the 1:50.000 maps. For this purpose, a 'M18d' Messerschmidt is bought for aerial photography. This is the first aircraft owned by the ''Eidgenossischie Landestopographie''. In 1938, the first map 1:50.000 is published: ''263 Wildstrubel''. From 1939 to 1945, all sales are suspended because of World War II. In 1939, the ''Eidgenossische Landestopographie'' also gets its first vehicle.
The first 1:25:000 map, ''1145 Bielersee'', is published in 1952. The last 1:25.000 map, ''1292 Maggia'', is published in 1979. This marks the finish of the lowest-scale mapping of Switzerland. The first composite in this scale, ''2501 St. Gallen'', was published in 1956. New composites still appear in 2004.
The 1:50.000 series was completed in 1963 with ''285 Domodossola''. With the publication of this map, the ''Siegfriedkarten'' have been entirely replaced. The first composite on this scale, ''5001 Gotthard'', was published in 1954. As of 2004, new composites still appear.
The 1:200.000 series started with No. 3 in 1971 and finished with No. 4 in 1976.
The maps on the scales 1:500.000 and 1:1.000.000 were respectively first published in 1965 and 1994. With the publication of the latter map, the work required by the Federal Act of 1935 was finally finished.
Since 1951, different sorts of leisure maps have been published by the Federal Office of Topography. See above for a list of those.
In 1958, the coordinate system of the maps is changed. Before 1958, the centre of the coordinate system, Bern, had coordinates (0, 0). From this moment, it has coordinates (600, 200). This is done so that any coordinate is either a x-coordinate or a y-coordinate: this prevents confusion about the order of the coordinates.
In 1968, the name officially becomes ''Eidgenossische Landestopographie'' instead of ''Abteilung fur Landestopographie'', although this had been common practice for decades. The English name remains unchanged (''Topographical Survey of Switzerland''). 
In 1979, the ''Eidgenossische Landestopographie'' is renamed to the current name ''Bundesamt fur Landestopographie''. See above for the names in other languages. Since 2002, the international name ''Swisstopo'' is acquired. This name had already been used since the homepage  went online in 1997.

Some maps produced by Swisstopo scarcely have any Switzerland on it. This is especially true for the scales 1:100.000 and 1:50.000. As can be seen , the map ''45 Haute Savoie'' only has a very little spot of Switzerland on it, in the extreme north-western corner. The same is true for the 1:50.000 map . In both cases, no 1:25.000 maps have been published for the corresponding part of the 1:50.000 map: at the 1:25.000 scale, some maps are a tiny bit larger than orders, to be able to get all of Switzerland onto a map without the need of maps with less than 0.1% domestic territory on it.
Initially, the plan was to be more generous also for 1:25.000 maps. Thirty-one maps were once planned, most of which did not have a single km^2 Switzerland on it, that were never published. Some of them (''1158 Zeinisjoch'') were up to ten kilometers away from the Swiss border. On old Swiss maps, one can still see the ''Blattubersicht'' were those are signified as ''planned maps''. 
Some maps have been published in the past, but have been discontinued, also because they lack any part of Switzerland. ''1035 Friedrichshafen'' is an example of that. When one looks at the , there is no map to the east or to the north of ''1055 Romanshorn''. However, when one then looks at the area of ''1055 Romanshorn'', it can be seen that these maps do in fact exist, but do not have any Swiss land on the map.
