This article is directed towards flashing the memory of cell phones.  Flash memory already has extensive information on flashing memory, and there is no need for an environment-specific article directly related to cell phones as the article details no notable differences or considerations that must be taken when flashing a cell phone, compared to other devices.  If the article is intended to be directed towards techniques for programming of mobile devices in general, then the FOTA, OTA, and FUMO articles already cover these concepts, and most of which are standardized by OMA.
