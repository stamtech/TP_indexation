GSAT-2 carried four C-band transponders, two Ku band transponders and a Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) payload operating in S-band forward link and C-band return link. Besides the communication payloads, GSAT-2 carried the following four piggyback experimental payloads:  
Weighing 1800&nbsp;kg at launch, GSAT-2 incorporated a 440 newton Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) and sixteen 22 newton Reaction Control Thrusters for raising the satellite's orbit from Geo-stationary Transfer orbit to its final geo- stationary orbit as well as for its altitude control. It carried 840&nbsp;kg of propellant (monomethyl hydrazine and MON-3). 
GSAT-2 measures 9.55 m in length in its final in-orbit configuration. It is 3-axis body stabilised using Sun and Earth sensors, momentum and reaction wheels, magnetic torquers and bi-propellant thrusters. Its solar array generates 1380 W power, backed up by two 24 A  h Ni-Cd batteries. 
After its launch into Geo-synchronous transfer orbit by GSLV-D2, GSAT-2 it was taken to its final geo-stationary orbit by firing the liquid apogee motor in phases. After it reached the geo-stationary orbit, its antenna and solar Panels were deployed and the satellite was finally placed in its allocated slot of 48   east longitude.
