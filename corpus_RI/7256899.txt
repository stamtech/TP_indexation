President Obama, like all humans, has millions of distant cousins. The recent American interest in geneology has enabled us to research our family trees and discover hitherto unknown relationships with people we have never met. President Obama is notable, the "cousins" listed on the page are also notable, the relationships between them are not notable; except maybe as trivia items in an individual bio.
