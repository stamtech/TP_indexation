Could a map of the Cheyenne, WY highway network be made? Please include I-25, I-80, I-180, US 30, US 85, US 87 shields. (And also WYO 212, 219, 221, 210, 222, 223, 225 or I can add these later).  Thank you very much!   ( ) 23:40, 27 February 2009 (UTC)

If a map of U.S. Route 62 could be made for New York like that of U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma that would be great!

Can someone fix the text on the SR-111 map? I think it involves converting the text to path... or something like that; same with   too -        23:24, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
Per the A-class review of this article, a request was made to add shields to the map. In addition, can the northbound ramp to NJ 87 near Brigantine be shown on the map as it is a part of the connector based on ?   ( ) 15:32, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
Hey, can PA maps be created for Pennsylvania Route 171 and Pennsylvania Route 737, two articles that need it? Thanks.3 1/2 years of    09:54, 3 June 2009 (UTC)
The current map is a bit unorthodox and not in .svg format, so if it's no trouble I'd like a replacement map.        17:32, 14 June 2009 (UTC)
The map that's currently on NY 192 is incorrect; NY 192's final alignment had it routed on modern NY 86 (see ). The current map should be redone to match the actual final alignment of NY 192; alternatively, this could be kept as a "historical" map and a new one could be made for its final alignment. If we elect to go with the latter, I can make the new map.     '''   ''' 19:07, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

To the archivist: It appears the requests for NJ 34, NJ 183 & 181, NJ 28, NJ 88, NJ 57, NJ 68, NJ 66, and NJ 73 have all been completed, as each of these articles now have maps. --  ( ) 20:09, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

As part of my review of all New York GA+ articles, I've found several NY Good Articles that do not have a map - 32 to be exact (not including things like county routes). Now, I can make a good number of these maps myself, but I'm asking for a bit of assistance because of the sheer number of maps. So I don't come off as a hypocrite, here's a list of only five:
Since I know full well how much of a PITA making maps are, I tried to keep them in the same general area so it won't be too difficult to move on from one project to the next. Thanks.     '''   ''' 06:21, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I just started the page for Florida State Road 116, and I need a map for the page.
Thank you for your help.
I've expanded this some, but it needs a map. If someone could talk me through it briefly I'd be interested in learning to do it myself. Thanks.   ( ) 01:40, 25 November 2008 (UTC)
GAN that needs a map. The route is a recently uograded freeway, so most map generating sites still do not show the new routing; the best I could find to use a reference is . (that may not be needed, but just in case :-) ) Thanks! Cheers,       17:34, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

I'm looking for another round of map requests; Florida State Road 50, Florida State Road 50A, Florida State Road 52, and Florida State Road 54. The second one may be more difficult because it's a short road in the center of Hernando County, Florida, which may not be recognizable outside of the Tampa Bay Area. ----  ( ) 01:29, 7 February 2009 (UTC)
Somebody added a redlink for the article U.S. Route 17 in South Carolina, which I created. I haven't found out who put the redlink in yet, but I'd like to see the map added in it's place, if nobody minds. ----  ( ) 23:34, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
