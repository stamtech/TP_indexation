The '''George R. Brown Convention Center'''  opened on September 26, 1987 on the east side of Downtown Houston, Texas, United States.
The center was named for the prominent Houstonian George R. Brown, an entrepreneur, civic leader and philanthropist. Brown   s Texas Eastern Corporation donated six of the 11 blocks required to build the convention center. The center is owned and operated by the City of Houston, Convention & Entertainment Facilities Department.  The facility was completed with a price tag of $104.9 million, requiring 30 months and more than 1,200 workers.  The sleek 100-foot (30 m) high red-white-and-blue building replaced the obsolete Albert Thomas Convention Center, which was later redeveloped into the Bayou Place entertainment complex in the downtown Houston Theater District.
The center sits where the Pillot House, a house owned by the family of one of the founders of the Henke & Pillot supermarket chain, used to be. The Pillot House was moved to Sam Houston Park in 1965.
The first convention held in the George R. Brown Convention Center began on October 11, 1987 for the American Society of Travel Agents. Renovations began on July 28, 2001 to expand the convention center and build an adjacent 1,200-room convention headquarters hotel at a cost of $165 million and requiring 27 months of construction. The adjacent hotel is the Hilton Americas-Houston and is connected to the convention center via two skywalks. The hotel and convention center are not connected to the Houston downtown tunnel system.  The project expanded the center from  to 1,800,000 square feet (107,000 to 167,000 m  ). Three exhibit halls were added to increase exhibition space from  to 853,500 square feet (42,000 to 79,000 m  ) and sixty-two meeting rooms were added for a total of 105.  Completion of the project concluded in September 2003 a few months before Super Bowl XXXVIII.  
At the same time, METRORail was completed on schedule (connecting downtown to the Houston Museum District, Texas Medical Center and Reliant Park), and what is deemed a revived downtown Houston has opened doors to future conventions (in 2004 and 2008, the Texas Democratic Convention was held at the GRB). The International Quilt Festival and International Quilt Market annually draws about 50,000 per year. In 2008, the  Discovery Green park was completed across the street and the three-block Houston Pavilions (a retail and entertainment complex, anchored by House of Blues) opened four blocks away. A new 700-car parking garage was built under Discovery Green to replace two surface lots removed to make way for the park. The convention center is flanked by Toyota Center (home of the Houston Rockets) and Minute Maid Park (home of the Houston Astros). With the new improvements, the George R. Brown Convention Center is one of the 10 largest in the nation.
After Hurricane Katrina, approximately 7,000 refugees went to the convention center, due to the Astrodome being at its full capacity.
In 2009, a televised audition of the show ''America's Got Talent'' was filmed at the convention center.
The ''Houston Press'' ranked the building as one of the ten least photogenic buildings in Downtown Houston. John Nova Lomax, the author of the list, commented "They say that architecture is frozen music. If you melted the George R. Brown, you   d hear Baby Jane singing    The Good Ship Lollipop.
