The '''Mitsubishi Carisma''' is a large family car, EuroNCAP produced for the European market by Mitsubishi Motors from 1995 to 2004. The model name was derived from a combination of the English ''car'' and the Greek ''kharisma'', meaning "divine gift"., p.33, Mitsubishi Motors website It was co-developed with Volvo, sharing its chassis with the first generation of the Volvo S40, and built at the NedCar factory in Born, Netherlands, which the two companies co-owned at the time. Over 350,000 were built during its production run., Yahoo Cars, October 6, 2004
Available as a 4-door saloon or a 5-door hatchback, it featured gasoline engines from 1.3&nbsp;L (introduced later in life) to 1.8&nbsp;L, a 1.8&nbsp;L gasoline direct injection engine, and  1.9&nbsp;L turbodiesel powerplants sourced from Renault, later with the  1.9&nbsp;DI-D common rail diesel engine, the same as used in both Volvo and Renault cars.
In spite of its name, the Carisma had a fairly neutral design as a result of being Mitsubishi's first attempt to target the traditionally conservative European company car market., Jason Dawe, ''The Sunday Times'', 17 October 2004 Even when receiving a midlife facelift in 1999 that characteristic was not improved. The car was placed between the Lancer and the Galant, although after production ended, the Lancer took its place in Mitsubishi's European range.
In several markets where the Lancer was not available, the Evolution version was rebadged as a Mitsubishi Carisma GT.
The chassis was also used by Proton to develop the Proton Waja.
