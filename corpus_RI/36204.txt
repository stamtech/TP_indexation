When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Clinton County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present state of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One  of the other pieces, Charlotte County, contained the eastern portion.
In 1784, the name "Charlotte County" was changed to Washington County to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America.
In 1788, Clinton County was split off from Washington County. This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including several other counties or county parts of the present New York State.
In 1799, Essex County was split off from Clinton County.
In 1802, parts of Clinton, Herkimer, and Montgomery counties were taken to form the new St. Lawrence County.
In 1808, Franklin County was split off from Clinton County.
Clinton County is considered a blue county.  It is frequently won by Democratic candidates in both national and statewide election.  In the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama carried the county by a 22.9% margin over John McCain (Obama won the county's every municipality), with Obama winning by a 26.9% margin over McCain statewide.  In 2006 both Eliot Spitzer and Hillary Clinton carried it winning 63 and 64 percent of vote.  In 2010 Andrew Cuomo, and Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand carried the county with over 60 percent of the vote. However, local races are most often won by Republican candidates.
