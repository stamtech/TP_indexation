Ford has also announced a 1.0 liter, three-cylinder engine for the EcoBoost family.   Specifications are not yet available.
EcoBoost gasoline direct-injection turbocharged engine technology adds 125 patents and patent applications to Ford's 4,618 active and thousands of pending U.S. patents.
The V6 EcoBoost engines are being assembled at Cleveland Engine Plant No. 1 in Brook Park, Ohio.
The 2.0&nbsp;L I4 EcoBoost engines will be produced at the Ford Valencia Engine Plant in Spain in 2009.
The 1.6&nbsp;L I4 EcoBoost engines will be made at the Ford Bridgend Engine Plant in the United Kingdom.
The future small displacement I4 EcoBoost engine will be produced both at the Ford Cologne Engine Plant in Germany and at Automobile Craiova in Romania.
By 2012, the company plans to produce 750,000 EcoBoost units annually in the US and 1.3 million globally in the world market. Ford expected over 90-percent of its global vehicle lineup (includes North American lineup) to offer EcoBoost engine technology by 2013.
Volvo used the term '''GTDi''' (Gasoline Turbocharged Direct injection) for the 1.6L I4 engine when introducing Volvo S60 Concept and for the 2.0L I4 engine when introducing Volvo XC60.
The first engine in the EcoBoost series is the V6. The engine first appeared in the 2007 Lincoln MKR Concept under the name '''TwinForce'''. The engine was designed to deliver power and torque output equivalent to a typical 6.0&nbsp;L or larger displacement V8 while achieving at least 15% better fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions compared to the V8 engine. In the MKR the concept TwinForce engine was rated  and  of torque, as well as run on E85 fuel.  When the same prototype engine reappeared in the Lincoln MKT concept in 2008 North American International Auto Show, the name was changed to EcoBoost.  Official EcoBoost production began on May 19, 2009 at Ford's Cleveland Engine Plant No. 1.
The production engines use the Duratec 35 V6 engine block. The fuel charging and delivery systems can attain high fuel pressures of up to 2150 PSI, necessary for efficient operation of the direct fuel injection system. It uses 2 Garrett GT15 turbochargers which can spin at up to 170,000 rpm and provide 12 PSI of boost. The engine can consume up to 25% more air over the naturally-aspirated counterpart. Through the use of direct injection, the engine needs only regular-grade gasoline to run, though premium fuel is recommended. The EcoBoost V6 was first available as an engine option for 2010 Lincoln MKS, followed by 2010 Ford Flex, 2010 Ford Taurus SHO, and 2010 Lincoln MKT.
The fuel charging and delivery systems were co-developed with Robert Bosch GmbH.
Ford also built an experimental 3.5&nbsp;L GTDI EcoBoost engine modified with E85 direct injection and gasoline port fuel injection, which achieved a BMEP score of 305 psi (27 bar), which translates to approximately  of torque and @3000rpm (flat torque curve from 1500-3000rpm).
Ford has so far unveiled three different four-cylinder engines equipped with EcoBoost technology in concept and production vehicles. Like the 3.5&nbsp;L EcoBoost V6, all the engines are turbocharged and direct injected. The production engine family was officially announced at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.
A 2.0&nbsp;L version was first seen in the 2008 Ford Explorer America Concept. The engine was rated at  and .
It is the first EcoBoost engine to include Twin-Independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT), with advertised 10-20% better fuel economy while maintaining the performance of 3.0 liter V6 engines. Power will be at least , and torque will be at least . Ford announced the production would begin in 2010.

Codenamed Bobcat, it is an expansion to the EcoBoost family. It is based on a 5.0&nbsp;L V8 engine block, but it uses E85 direct injection and gasoline port injection. The engine was co-developed with Ethanol Boosting Systems, LLC of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Bobcat project was unveiled in Department of Energy and Society of Automotive Engineers in April 2009.
Codenamed Road Runner, it is rumored to be a 500&nbsp;hp engine to be used in the 2012 Shelby GT500 and F-150 Harley-Davidson edition pickups.  The "Road Runner" is not considered a part of the EcoBoost family as it does not feature direct injection.
2012 GT500 engine specs have been released with no change to the current drivetrain.
