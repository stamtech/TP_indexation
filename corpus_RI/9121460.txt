Starting as early as 1861 these regiments were often referred to as the '''"volunteer army" (not capitalized) of the United States''' but not officially named (codified into law) that until 1898.
During the nineteenth century this was the United States federal government's main means for raising large forces of citizen-soldiers needed in wartime to augment the small Regular Army and organized militia and National Guard.  The U.S. Volunteers were the forerunner of the National Army in World War One and the Army of the United States in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.
The U.S. Volunteers did not exist in peacetime. Unlike the militia, which, under the United States Constitution, each state recruited, trained, equipped, and maintained locally, with regimental officers appointed and promoted by state governors and not kept in federal service for more than nine months nor sent outside the country, the U.S. Volunteers were enlisted for terms of one to three years, and between 1794 and 1902 fought outside the country.
Regiments and batteries became known as "Volunteers" to distinguish between state and regular army units.
The great majority of soldiers who served during the War of 1812 were volunteers, or members of state militia who were federalized for portions of the war period. There were also volunteer units directly raised by the federal government.  
U.S. Volunteers were seen as "temporary regulars" because they were not state troops but rather augmented the Regular Army.
