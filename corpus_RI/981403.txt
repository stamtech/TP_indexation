A '''chip race''' is an event that takes place in poker tournaments, especially those with an escalating blinds (such as Texas hold 'em), in which chips of denominations that are no longer needed (as the current and upcoming blinds are more easily played with larger chip values) are removed from play.  This has the effect of reducing the number of physical chips in front of any player, and makes it easier for the players to count their stacks and their bets.
In a typical chip race:
A chip race cannot eliminate a player from the game.  In the event a player's last smaller-denomination chips are removed from play as part of the chip race, he automatically gets one colored up chip if one is available.  Any leftover colored up chips go to the winner(s) of the chip race as described above.
