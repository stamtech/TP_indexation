I came across the article when it was flagged for cleanup and NPOV disputed. (22:06, 16 December 2005 is the state I first saw it in.) I started making changes, trying to correct the obvious bias against Willow Creek and Bill Hybels, as well as irrellevent information concerning Purpose Driven Life and Rick Warren. In the talk page, there have been minor disputes, which I will let you read. hopefully I didnt sound attacking, because I wasnt trying to be. basically Fides Viva wants to have a long list of links and quotes which are anti-Bill Hybels because he/she claims, "Bill Hybels is a false teacher, just like Rick Warren and Robert Schuller and he and his Willow Creek association are deceiving millions of people around the world and should be thoroughly exposed for the "wolves in sheeps clothing" they are."
It seems like some of this is bordering on vandalism (the last change was made by Fides Viva and is just pasting those links in at the bottom) since there is an obvious axe to grind. I want to remove the NPOV problems and I want an outside source (you) to help be a neutral party in this discussion. Thanks!--  21:50, 22 December 2005 (UTC) P.S. you can contact me on my talk page
Greetings,
These criticisms are from legitimate sources, therefore they should not be removed.  However, I agree that the section is overbearing, messy, long, and needs cleanup, but not removal.  Put the criticism back in, tone it down, and clean it up.  It may be necessary to move much of it to its own page.
