In human genetics, '''Haplogroup IJK''' is a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup.
Haplogroup IJK is a descendant branch of the macrohaplogroup F with haplogroup IJ and haplogroup K as its attested descendants.
According to Family Tree DNA, the two SNPs defining this haplogroup unite I, J, and K within F as a "brother clade" to G and H. FTDNA further states that haplogroup IJK's relationship with haplogroup F1 through F4 is unknown.
This phylogenetic tree of haplogroup  subclades is based on the YCC 2008 tree and subsequent published research.
Some of the main branches within the group are shown below:-
The defining SNP ''L15'' is located at Y chromosomal location rs9786139 with the ancestral value being '''A''' and the derived value being '''G'''.
The defining SNP ''L16'' is at location rs9786714 with the ancestral value being '''G''' and the derived value being '''A'''.
