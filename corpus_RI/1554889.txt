During his early years in Pakistan, Habib was the Pakistan 14-and-under National Tennis Champion. Habib went to America at the age of 18 to study business at the University of Redlands. He also once owned a nationwide chain of video stores. He began playing casino poker in 1985, and had his first poker tournament cash in 1993. 
The following year he made the final table of the $25,000 WPT Championship again. He finished in third place ($896,375), but also had a stake on eventual winner Tuan Le. Observers have commented that this may have affected the interaction between them on the final table, however Habib has made it clear he was still playing to win, citing that the endorsements would have made it more financially viable.
As of 2009, he has cashed fourteen times in the World Series of Poker (WSOP), including a 2nd place finish in $2,500 Omaha Hi-Lo Split event in 2000, and a 4th place finish in the $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em Main Event in the same year, for which he took home $326,000. In September 2005, he won the opening No Limit Hold'em event of PokerStars' fourth annual World Championship of Online Poker, taking home $306,000. 
In 2010, Habib finished 4th at the WPT Bay 101 Shooting Star Championship for $234,300. Habib also finished 14th in the 2010 WSOP Main Event for $500,165.
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings to date exceed $5,100,000. His 18 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,401,417 of those winnings.
