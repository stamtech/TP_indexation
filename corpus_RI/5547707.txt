This article contains the '''results of the 2008 Republican presidential primaries and caucuses'''.
The 2008 Republican primaries are the selection processes by which the Republican Party selects delegates to attend the 2008 Republican National Convention. The series of primaries, caucuses, and state conventions culminates in the National Convention which was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, September 1   4, 2008, where the delegates voted on and selected a candidate. A simple majority of delegate votes in September (1,191 out of 2,380) is required to become the party's nominee; estimates based on delegate pledges had John McCain surpassing this total after the March 4 primaries in Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.
The only candidate with a national campaign is John McCain. Withdrawn candidates who had national campaigns are Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee, Sam Brownback, John H. Cox, Jim Gilmore, Rudy Giuliani, Duncan Hunter, Mitt Romney, Tom Tancredo, Fred Thompson, and Tommy Thompson.
The data contained in the row entitled ''Actual pledged delegates'' is a subset of the data in the row entitled ''Estimated pledged delegates''. It represents delegates won in contests where the final apportionment of delegates has already been decided, but does not include delegates from contests where the final apportionment depends upon the outcome of further caucuses or conventions.  Caveat lector: the below "Estimated total delegates" row totals 2,390 delegates, but there are only 2,380 delegates.
