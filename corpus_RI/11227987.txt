This article is an essay which lacks  , with almost all of its content not covered by  , but instead combines a bit of material from the few sources provided with the blanks filled with a lot of content I considered blatant original research (see  ). The only notable content in the article can be summarized to "''plug-in electric vehicles charged with energy generated from solar panels (off-board source) have no carbon footprint''" which is not enough for a stand alone article not even a stub. In this case merging is not an option, since the closest article, solar vehicle, refers to vehicles powered by an on-board source that generates electricity from the sun (such possible merge lready was discussed ). The following are common sense examples of fictional article's also lacking notability that follow the same logic and content of the questioned article: wind-charged electric vehicles, coal-charged electric vehicles, solar-charged portable music players (solar-charged iPad?), etc. In summary, the article takes two notable subjects, solar energy and electric vehicle, and simply pasted them together. Also notice that the only relevant link to this article is the Spanish Wikipedia , which was created by  , who recently, and one more time, has been blocked indefinitely as a sock puppet (see ) and not surprisingly is the second contributor to the English version.--   ( ) 05:30, 22 May 2011 (UTC)
