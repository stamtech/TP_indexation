Born in Princeton, Illinois, Lay was injured playing football while attending the United States Naval Academy, which ended his plans for military service. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa in 1949 and received his law degree in 1951. After working as a trial lawyer in Milwaukee and Omaha, he was appointed to the Eighth Circuit at age 39 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
One of his most notable rulings was ''Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'', a landmark sexual harassment case that was the subject of the 2005 film ''North Country''. His 1971 dissent on behalf of two Iowa convicts whose parole was revoked without trial in ''Morrissey v. Brewer'' was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States, as was his dissent in ''Jaycees v. McClure'', which compelled the Jaycees to admit women.
He was a dissenter in the controversial case ''USA v. $124,700'' that upheld civil forfeiture of properties possibly connected to drugs.
From 1995 to 2001, he served as a full-time visiting faculty member at William Mitchell College of Law.  He died at his home in North Oaks, Minnesota.Hevesi, Dennis (May 2, 2007). Donald P. Lay, 80, Federal Judge Notable in Rights Cases, Dies. ''New York Times''
