Mitchell served in the Forty-second United States Congress and Forty-third United States Congress. He was nominated for Governor of Wisconsin in 1877, but he declined. Mitchell is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.
He was an avid curler, having helped found the Milwaukee Curling Club in the 1840s, and was shortly before his death elected the "patron" of the Grand National Curling Club.
Both Mitchell Park and the street Mitchell Boulevard were named in his honor, as was the city of Mitchell, South Dakota, incorporated in 1881.  
He married Martha Reed, sister of the politian Harrison Reed. His son, John L. Mitchell, was a politician, and his grandson, Billy Mitchell, is regarded as the father of the U.S. Air Force.
