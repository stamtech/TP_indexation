The Commissioners are the chief executive and legislative officials of the County, which has 500,000 residents spread over  and an annual County budget of $300 million. 
Henderson was previously Head of Public Health for the City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the County seat. 
Henderson is a notable opponent of the Lancaster County Convention Center Authority's controversial $170 million hotel/convention center in downtown Lancaster on the site of the former Watt & Shand building.
The hotel portion of the project is owned 50% by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. which have been accused of using their monopoly print position in the County to promote the project and stifle opposition. Henderson has been referenced in more than 2,200 newspaper articles, over 700 of which concern the Lancaster County Convention Center project, many of them attacking her position.
Henderson, along with fellow commissioners Dick Shellenberger and Pete Staub, pleaded guilty to violating Pennsylvania's state Sunshine Act in 2007.
Henderson was not re-elected as Lancaster County Commissioner on November 7, 2007.
