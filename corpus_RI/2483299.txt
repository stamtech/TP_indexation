The '''Discovery Science Center''', formerly known as the '''Taco Bell Discovery Science Center''', is a science museum in Santa Ana, California, with more than 100 hands-on science exhibits designed to spark children's natural curiosity.  It has become a visual landmark due to its ten-story solar array cube that stands over Interstate 5.
The center is divided into several themed areas: Discovery Stadium, Techno Arts, Air & Space, Perception, Dynamic Earth, Quake Zone, the Digital Lab and KidStation. Some of the available exhibits at the museum include Dino Quest, an interactive work which opened in 2006 and includes life-size dinosaurs; and Science of Hockey, which opened in 2009 and presents the various scientific aspects behind the game of hockey with the help of the Anaheim Ducks franchise.
In 1984, the Boards of the Exploratory Learning Center and the Experience Center joined to form the Discovery Museum of Orange County with the dual goals of teaching children what life was like in Orange County in the 1900s and creating a world-class science center. A funding feasibility study in 1989 indicated that county leaders would support the project. The  facility was opened on December 17, 1998.
