Contributions are covered by the CC-BY-SA license. The software used includes Semantic MediaWiki, which enables the connection of people to events and places, and to other people (e.g., inbreeding), as well as  , for ease of data entry.
Familypedia does not have any notability requirements for the people listed, but it does have many prominent families (e.g., the royals of France, Germany and the  UK) and people (e.g., some ancestry of every president of the  USA) as well as unexpected facts (such as the relationship between Brooke Shields and Charlemagne).  The family relationships are usually more detailed than on corresponding Wikipedia pages. The data input form asks every contributor of new articles to list sources.
Familypedia's pages about historical figures commonly appear in the top ten listings of a Google search, some in the top three.
Ed West, writing in the British newspaper ''The Telegraph'', has said, "It   s a brilliant idea, and if it reaches critical mass it will become enormously important, being a free database of humanity   s entire family tree. Not only will Familypedia be of interest to family tree nerds and journalists, it may also bring humanity together a little bit, reminding us of John Ball   s words:    When Adam delved and Eve span, Who was then the gentleman?   "  
In their book ''The Online Genealogy Handbook'' Brad Schepp and Debra Schepp wrote, "Familypedia, the genealogy wiki, is a place where you can write articles about your family and link these articles to others that discuss where and when an ancestor once lived" 
On Remembrance Day in November 2010, popular genealogy blogger Dick Eastman gave Familypedia a largely favorable 17-paragraph review.
