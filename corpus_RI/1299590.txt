The movie starts with a TV crew interviewing Prof. Tiwari (Pankaj kapoor) for the events that had occurred in reference to the movie shootouts and eradication of organized crime in lucknow and surrounding areas. Since a very tender age, Ajay Kumar (Arshad Warsi) is traumatized with the death of his army officer father, who kills himself with his service revolver as he was being accused of being a deserter, leaving a widowed Prabha (Suhasini Mulay) to bring up Ajay on her own. Ajay grows up, studies, and successfully becomes an IPS officer with the title of SSP. Due to his honesty, he gets transferred to various states in India. At his new posting in Uttar Pradesh he comes to terms with a new criminal don and ruthless killer, Gajraj Singh (Sushant Singh). Ajay engineers the set up of a Special Task Force to deal with Gajraj, however, he also runs into problems as Gajraj is politically well-connected. Gajraj continues to elude the STF, using more modern technology such as the use of cell phones. But the STF bounces back and is able to monitor Gajraj's cell phones - only to find out that Gajraj is planning to contest the elections; and if he wins, no police officer of any rank, leave alone the STF, can dare to arrest him or even consider him a suspect, which may well result in the STF being mere paper tigers. They have a final confrontation inside a train which just leaves for H. Nizamuddin station. All the characters in the STF as well as members of Gajraj's gang kill each other in fight leaving only the Prof. Tiwari as the witness to all of this.
The movie is loosely based on the encounter of the notorious criminal Shiv Prakash Shukla Alias Shri Prakash Shukla who was eliminated by the newly formed  Special Task Force of the Uttar Pradesh Police. He was not only a dreaded gangster but also an amalgam between the underworld and the politicians.
The character of SSP Ajay Kumar is based on SSP and chief of STF Arun Kumar.
