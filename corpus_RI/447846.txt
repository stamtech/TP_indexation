The oldest of three children, Brooks grew up in Long Beach. He was given a keyboard by his father after being inspired by the piano players he saw in church.
During his teenage years, Brooks met rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. Proving himself with his keyboard skills, Soopafly was assigned his first piece of work for Death Row Records on the soundtrack ''Murder Was The Case''. He played keyboards for Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the track "Natural Born Killaz", as well as his first production credit with "Who Got Some Gangsta Shit" featuring the Dogg Pound and company. In 1995, he produced "Sooo Much Style" for Tha Dogg Pound on their debut album "Dogg Food". He also played the keyboards on eight other songs throughout. Then in 1996, he was featured on the soundtrack to the movie ''A Thin Line Between Love and Hate'' on the song "I Don't Hang." A remix would later follow.
Soopafly was further introduced to mainstream listeners on Snoop Dogg's second studio album ''Tha Doggfather''. He produced the songs "Freestyle Conversation" and "You Thought", appearing alongside veteran rapper Too Short.

After inking a deal with Koch Records and Doggystyle Records, the official debut album   was released on September 2, 2008. Prior to the release, the group and the labels were approached by the company Western Union, threatening legal action if the name was not changed. Though there is a difference between Westurn and Western, the labels did not want to spend money dealing with a lawsuit,  the name of the group was changed to Dubb Union.
