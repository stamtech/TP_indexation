It has sold 500,000 copies according to TvT Records by December 16, 2004. The reunion of the band first appeared as 213 in Warren G's ''The Return of the Regulator'' in the track "Yo' Sassy Ways". In 2003 Snoop Dogg, released his series of mixtapes, from which the second compilation ''Welcome to tha chuuch, Vol. 2'' included the first version of "So Fly", which is a parody of the then chart-running hit single by Monica, So Gone. Missy Elliott, the producer of the song, got to hear the tape and was very impressed by it. She agreed with Snoop to cede the right of the sample for the upcoming 213 project in exchange for their rapping on Tamia's "Can't Go for That" remix. In the end it came out to be the first unofficial radio single of ''The Hard Way'' and was performed live at BET's 106 & Park. The album version differs from the mixtape version in a way that it is five seconds shorter and misses Snoop's intro where he gives the shootouts "Welcome to tha chuuch Vol. 2...exclusive 213". The official debut retail single was "Groupie Luv", which was also accompanied by a promo video. It was directed by Chris Robinson and saw the video debut for dancer  and was shot in Snoop Dogg's own house (see also Still a G Thang).
