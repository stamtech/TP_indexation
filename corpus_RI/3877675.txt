The 33rd District is an inland Orange County District. It encompasses a number of middle class and upper-middle class suburbs as well as the Orange County portion of the Cleveland National Forest. These suburbs range from well-established neighborhoods to newly developed ones.
The district includes cities in north, central, and south Orange County. A quarter of the district is in North Orange County, including most of Fullerton and portions of Buena Park and Anaheim. Another quarter live in Central Orange County, where the district takes in Orange, Villa Park, Tustin, Silverado, a slice of Irvine, and a small, very Republican segment of Santa Ana.
The remainder of the district is in South Orange County and includes all of the cities not touching the Pacific Ocean, including Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Mission Viejo, Aliso Viejo, and Rancho Santa Margarita. The unincorporated areas of Coto de Caza, and Foothill Ranch are also in the district.
Population growth in south Orange County forced the formerly compact district to shift southward. Redistricting removed Brea, Yorba Linda, Placentia, La Habra, and part of the Anaheim portion from the district. The three Lagunas and Aliso Viejo were then added, shifting the gravity of the district decidedly southward.
