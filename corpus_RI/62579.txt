Deschutes is the fastest-growing county in Oregon.
French-Canadian fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company gave the name Riviere des Chutes (River of the Falls) to the Deschutes River, from which the county derived its name.
On December 13, 1916, Deschutes County was created from the southern part of Crook County. Bend has been the county seat since the county's formation. It was the last county in Oregon to be established.
The Shevlin-Hixon Lumber Company also operated within the Bend area processing Ponderosa pine trees.
During the 1990s, Deschutes County experienced the most rapid growth of any county in Oregon largely due to the availability of recreation activities year-round, and its location as the nearest population center to much of the central Cascade Range. Beyond tourism, principal industries in the county are lumber, ranching and agriculture   chiefly potatoes. The Forest Service owns 51% of the lands within the county boundaries.
Deschutes County is the home of four ''destination resorts'' as defined by Oregon's Department of Land Conservation and Development.  These resort are major employers within the county.  Three of these resorts, Sunriver, Eagle Crest, and Pronghorn, are among the county's ten largest tax payers.
Deschutes County politically falls more in line with the eastern side of the state than the western side. The majority of registered voters who are part of a political party in Deschutes County, as well as most counties in eastern Oregon, are members of the Republican Party. In the 2008 presidential election 48.96% of Deschutes County voters voted for Republican John McCain, while 48.66% voted for Democrat Barack Obama and 2.37% of voters either voted for a Third Party candidate or wrote in a candidate. These numbers represented a significant shift towards the Democratic candidate when compared to the 2004 presidential election, in which 56.4% of Deschutes Country voters voted for George W. Bush, while 42.1% voted for John Kerry, and 1.5% of voters either voted for a third-party candidate or wrote in a candidate.
In 2008, the Oregon house seat encompassing the city of Bend switched parties and now hosts the only Democratic state legislator from a district east of the Cascades.

The overall defining landscape of Deschutes County is primarily marked with that of lava flows. Most of the lava found in Deschutes County issued forth from Newberry Volcano located just south of Bend. Because of this, many lava tubes are located within, including the prominent Lava River Cave. As a consequence, the county is the most cave-rich in the state of Oregon, with over 250 known caves in the Deschutes National Forest alone.
Large volcanoes serve as a backdrop to the city of Bend in Deschutes County, ranging from the prominent Three Sisters, Mt. Washington, Mt. Bachelor, Broken Top, Newberry, Tumalo Mountain, Maiden Peak and others. A group of geologists have discovered Smith Rock State Park is part of an ancient supervolcano called the Crooked River caldera with a rim nearly six times the diameter of Newberry Volcano's caldera. This ancient supervolcano has long gone extinct. Its crater rim is barely recognizable as remnants mark portions of Powell Buttes, Gray Butte, and the western front of the Ochoco Mountains at Barnes Butte.
On the eastern side of the county, it is mostly characterized by large buttes of much older volcanic origin. Most of these did not create any proper lava flows, or at least none that are known to exist. Some of the prominent buttes include: Horse Ridge, Pine Mountain, China Hat, and several others on the county border.
Two main types of lava flows are found within the county. The most common are the pahoehoe flows which have been partially buried by volcanic ash, tephra deposits, and dirt over tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The aa flows are fewer, but are much more prominent, with the most notable being associated with Lava Butte and the Lava Cast Forest in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument.
