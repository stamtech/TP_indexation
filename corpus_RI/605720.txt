Bechtel was also one of the players to make the final table of the inaugural $50,000 H.O.R.S.E. event of the 2006 World Series of Poker, which was won by Chip Reese.  The players at the final table for this event were one of the most accomplished groups of poker players ever to sit at a WSOP final table.  The table included two world champions, Bechtel himself and Doyle Brunson, WSOP bracelet winners T. J. Cloutier, Phil Ivey, Dewey Tomko, Chip Reese, as well as established professionals David Singer who has since won a bracelet, Patrik Antonius, and Andy Bloch who finished runner-up in the tournament.  Bechtel was eliminated after his pocket 7's were beaten by Bloch's pocket 10's.  Bechtel earned $549,120 for his fourth-place finish.
In 2009, Bechtel competed in the WSOP Champions Invitational tournament, open only to players who have won the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event at the World Series of Poker.  The tournament drew 20 out of the 24 living former world champions, and the ten-handed final table was broadcast by ESPN.  Bechtel finished fourth place in the tournament, which was won by 1983 World Champion Tom McEvoy.
As of 2009, his total tournament winnings exceed $2,500,000. His 23 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,809,967 of those winnings.
