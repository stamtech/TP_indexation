The northern terminus of CR&nbsp;9 was originally located at Quaker Avenue in Cornwall, then designated as part of '''New York State Route&nbsp;307'''. NY&nbsp;307 continued north on Main Street to Academy Avenue, where it ended at NY&nbsp;218. In 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY&nbsp;307 was transferred to Orange County, and its routing became part of two county routes: an extended CR&nbsp;9 and the new '''County Route&nbsp;107'''.
Route&nbsp;9 begins at an intersection with NY&nbsp;32 in Central Valley, just north of its intersection with NY&nbsp;17. The route heads northeastward, passing homes and tree patches. There are intersections with local roads, as Route&nbsp;9, also known as Smith Clove Road, crosses the New York State Thruway (I-87). The road continues, passing Filters Lake and Central Valley Golf Club. Soon afterwards, Route&nbsp;9 passes through a large patch of forests, which also covers parts of West Point Military Academy. 
Smith Clove Road continues, passing forests to the east and homes to the west. The highway parallels Interstate&nbsp;87 and New York State Route&nbsp;32, as it progresses farther to the northeast. Soon after, Smith Clove Road becomes completely full of forests and grass, with homes becoming scarce. County Route&nbsp;34 (Trout Brook Road) terminates at CR&nbsp;9 while the road continues towards Cornwall. Whispering Brook is afterwards, a small road on the east of CR&nbsp;9. 
Route&nbsp;9 becomes known as Mineral Springs Road and continues northward through forests. County Route&nbsp;65 (Angola Road) terminates at CR&nbsp;9 soon after. However, the name Angola Road continues to the north along CR&nbsp;9. As the highway approaches Cornwall, it becomes more suburbanized, with the Carvey-Gatfield House approachable on the east. With NY&nbsp;32 parallelling to the north, Angola Road continues into Cornwall. Just before the overpass of U.S. Route&nbsp;9W, Route&nbsp;9 passes the Cromwell Manor, an early-19th century house.
Just after the overpass comes the David Sutherland House, a stone structure dating back to 1770. His descendant also has a house along Route&nbsp;9, Daniel Sutherland House, which is located at the Chadeayne Circle. The highway there continues along Main Street, an urbanized, 3-lane highway until its terminus at NY&nbsp;218 in Cornwall-on-Hudson.
Route&nbsp;9 is longer than 5 state-maintained highways in Orange County. NY&nbsp;210, NY&nbsp;284, NY&nbsp;293, NY&nbsp;416, and the new NY&nbsp;747 are all shorter than CR&nbsp;9.
On January&nbsp;9, 1980, the NY&nbsp;307 designation was removed from the entirety of its routing. Ownership and maintenance of both NY&nbsp;307's former routing west of Hudson Street and Main Street between Hudson Street and NY&nbsp;218 was transferred from the state of New York to Orange County roughly three months later on April&nbsp;1 as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Following the swap, CR&nbsp;9 was extended northward along Main Street to a new terminus at NY&nbsp;218 while NY&nbsp;307's former routing along Quaker Avenue was designated as CR&nbsp;107.
Originally, CR&nbsp;9's Mineral Springs Road segment had a longer alignment within the forests south of Angola Road. This was realigned and the old alignment became known as Old Mineral Springs Road.
