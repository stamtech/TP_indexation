In his early days at Austin Rover Stephen worked on the Austin Montego, Rover 800 as well as a large number of unreleased cars, working at the Canley Studios in Coventry.
Stephen then moved to Volvo BV in the Netherlands to help with the Volvo 480 and Volvo 440 before returning to the UK to work for MGA. It was here that Stephen became involved with Rover Special products, creating the initial design for the MGF as well as a number of other niche Rovers that weren't released.
From there, Stephen worked on various projects in the UK before returning to Volvo (this time in Sweden) in 2000, when he became hugely influential in the creation of Volvo's post-millennial re-definition of the brand, having designed a string of cars for the company.
Returned to the UK in 2007, where he once again set up SHADO Ltd (SHADO is the acronym of "Steve Harper Art & Design Organisation") as a Design Consultancy,as Managing Director, this time in Paignton in Devon.
