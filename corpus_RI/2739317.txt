The movie stars Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Doris Day, and Hoagy Carmichael, and was directed by Michael Curtiz and produced by Jerry Wald. The screenplay was written by Carl Foreman and Edmund H. North.
As a young boy, after his mother dies, Rick Martin sees a trumpet in the window of a pawn shop. He works in a bowling alley to save up enough money to buy it.
Rick grows up to be an outstanding musician, tutored by jazz man Art Hazzard. He moves to New York and lands a job playing for the big band of Jack Chandler, getting to know piano player Smoke Willoughby and beautiful singer Jo Jordan.
Chandler orders him to always play the music exactly as written. Rick prefers to improvise, so after hours he jams in a small jazz club nearby. But one night during a break with Chandler's band he launches into an impromptu solo, which gets him fired.
Jo has fallen for Rick and finds him a job with a dance orchestra. One night, her friend Amy North accompanies her to hear Rick play. Amy is a complicated woman studying to be a psychiatrist, still disturbed by her own mother's suicide. She claims to be incapable of feeling love, but she and Rick begin an affair and eventually are married.
Rarely together at the same time because of the hours they keep, Rick and Amy constantly quarrel. She fails in her attempt to become a doctor and takes it out on Rick, demanding a divorce. He begins drinking and his mood deteriorates to the point that one day he even takes it out on Art Hazzard, a man who had done so much for him. Before he can apologize, Art is hit by a car and killed.
Rick becomes an alcoholic who neglects his music and even destroys his horn. He disappears until one day Smoke finds him in a drunk tank. Jo is contacted and rushes to Rick's side, helping him to recover his love of music and of her.
Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being a friend of the real Beiderbecke.
