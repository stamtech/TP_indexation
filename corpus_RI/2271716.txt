The '''John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center''' located in Boston was built in 1988 from a design by architects Kallmann, McKinnell & Wood. It replaced a previous building, also a convention center, regarded as "ungainly." The 1988 design "attempted to relate in scale and materials to its Back Bay setting, adopting granite and setbacks... The severe gray interior is reminiscent of an early 20th-century German railroad station."  The Center is named after former Boston mayor John Hynes. 
The building has  of exhibit space and can accommodate up to four concurrent events. It features  of meeting space with 38 permanent rooms and a  grand ballroom.
The convention center is connected by aerial passageways to a nearby hotel complex and can be reached by public transportation via the Hynes Convention Center station on the MBTA Green Line and, using the passageways, via the Back Bay (MBTA station) station on the Orange Line, commuter rail and Amtrak.
