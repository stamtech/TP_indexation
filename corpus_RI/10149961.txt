He currently lives and works in Italy.
Dillon uses a stencil and spray paint technique to create his work. His work has been called "pop avante-garde." He is reportedly inspired by artists involved with the Street Art and Pop Art movements, such as Banksy and Shephard Fairey.
During the 2008 Obama presidential campaign, Dillon's work was included alongside Fairey's stylized stencil portrait of Barack Obama, known as the Barack Obama "Hope" poster. His own portrait of Barack Obama, titled "The Blue Knight," used acrylic, spray paint and oil markers. It was featured in the same TIME Magazine Person of the Year 2008 article that featured Fairey's Barack Obama "Hope" poster on the cover.
