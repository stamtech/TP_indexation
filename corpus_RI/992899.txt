A '''voter database''' is a database containing information on voters for the purpose of assisting a political party or an individual politician, in their Get out the vote (GOTV) efforts and other areas of the campaign. 
In most countries, the election agency makes the electoral roll available to all campaigns soon after the election campaign has begun. Campaigns can then merge this information with the other data they have collected on voters over the years to create their database.  Often basic information such as phone numbers and postal codes are not included on the voters list, and the campaign will have to procure this data as well.
The United States has no state or federal election agency, and thus no central lists. In 2002, the United States Congress passed HAVA, the Help America Vote Act. HAVA required that each state compile an official state voter database by January 2006. Most states complied with HAVA by gathering the voter files available from each individual county. States decided what information to include, what restrictions to place on the use of their voter database, and how much the database would cost. In the United States, several companies have merged state voter information with commercially obtained data to create comprehensive voter databases that include a plethora of personal details on each voter.  These companies often provide United States Voter Files to statutorily permitted or otherwise non-restricted users.
The voter database is central to many parts of a campaign:
Personal data frequently included in a voter database:
Data that may be added via commercial routes:
The use of voter databases has been established in political campaigns from local school board to national elections:
In the 2004 presidential election in the United States, the Republican Party used the Voter Vault platform and the Democratic Party used DataMart. Currently, the Republicans use Voter Vault 3 and the Democrats use Votebuilder from the Voter Activation Network (VAN).
In 2005, the British Conservative Party used the Voter Vault software to assist them in the 2005 General Election. 
Britain's Labour Party has used a variety of voter databases through the past two decades. Its most recent incarnation is the Labour Contact Creator system, an online tool accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. Party members and activists are provided with a username and password and voter contact details, preferences, interests, past voting behaviour, and demographic/socio-economic information are available. The system allows voters to be selected on the basis of a MOSAIC grouping, which attempts to determine the sort of interests and activities a voter or a household might display. Maps of where key voters live and information can be cross-referenced so users can find where target voters live, how often they are contacted, how they prefer to be contacted, and what responses have been provided upon making contact.
The Contact Creator system is also linked with the Labour Party's other new media tools, Print Creator and Email Creator. Print Creator allows key voters identified through Contact Creator to be targeted with direct mails and leaflets about Labour Party activity. Email Creator allows the user to collect a list of email addresses on the Contact Creator system, e-mail thousands of voters, and monitor the response rate from targets.
The Labour Party also operates 'Membersnet', which allows party members to update their registration details, inform other members and Party HQ of rival campaign activities, create events and invite others to attend, email members, create blogs, and share best practice campaign material.
The Labour Party is just about to introduce a new system to Membersnet and Contact Creator, which will allow Party Members anywhere in the UK to contact target voters and identify their voting preferences. They will then be able to enter the information gained directly into the Contact Creator system.
In Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada uses the , originally developed by the same company which produced Trackright, which the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, uses to manage voter information. It is similar to the Voter Vault software. The New Democratic Party uses their own custom database system called NDP Vote. The Liberal Party has recently introduced "" based on the US's Democrats' Voter Activation Network (VAN) Previously the Liberals used a system called ManagElect
The availability of voter files sometimes creates a need for voter list management software as opposed to, for example, using Excel spreadsheets. Political campaigns generally have three options:
