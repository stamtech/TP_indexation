The organization was established to solve grave problems like drinking water quality, female education, health and sanitation, rural unemployment, income generation, electricity and power, as well as social awareness and the conservation of ecological systems in rural India. Bunker Roy, born to a wealthy Indian family, received what he described as a "very snobby, elitist, expensive education," which he believes imparts arrogance without providing the kind of practical knowledge needed in poor villages. His decision to leave the city for the village estranged him from his parents, furthering his conviction that "such an education can destroy you." 
The policy of the Barefoot College is to take women from the poorest of villages and teach them to become professionals without requiring them to read or write. In extreme cases, there are students without verbal fluency in the languages of their teachers. It is the only school with such a policy, as well as the only school in India that is entirely solar-powered. Keeping with the principles of the Barefoot College, solar panels were installed by a Hindu priest with only eight years of schooling, and many of the builders were themselves illiterate.
One program of the Barefoot College brings women from villages in rural Africa that run without electricity to the Barefoot College. They are then trained by local Indian women at the Barefoot College. At the end of their training, they return to Africa with new skills that allow them to install solar electricity in their villages.
In 2003, the Barefoot College won an Ashden Award for its work bringing solar power to rural villages.
