Ruane met Warren Buffett at an investment seminar with value investing guru Benjamin Graham and he and Buffett became lifelong friends. Buffett advised associates to invest with Ruane after he had closed out his initial partnership as they both employed Graham's value investing techniques.  Ruane founded his own investment firm, Ruane Cunniff, with partner Rick Cunniff in 1970, and the same year they launched their flagship Sequoia Fund. The fund has routinely outperformed the S&P 500 index and has been one of the top performing mutual funds. In the 38 years in which Sequoia has been operational, the fund has averaged a return of approximately 15% versus about 13% for the S&P 500. 
Ruane's firm was renamed Ruane, Cunniff, and Goldfarb in 2004, when Robert Goldfarb became president. In 2008, the Sequoia Fund announced it would open its fund to new investors for the first time since 1982.
In 1992 he adopted a block in Harlem, committed to make it a better place, renovating buildings and establishing clinics and community service programs. Ruane gave every child on the block a scholarship to a Catholic school. He also funded programs at public schools and schools on Indian reservations, and contributed to mental health causes.
He died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Survivors at time of death included his wife, Joy Ruane of New York; four children, music promoter William Ruane Jr. of Cambridge, Mass. (1957-2010); Elizabeth Ruane of Burlington, Vt., Thomas Ruane of Washington, Conn., and Paige Ruane of New York; a sister, Patricia Lowry of Maui, Hawaii; and four granddaughters.
