The '''Nanosat-1B''' Spanish satellite, designed, developed and operated by the Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial (National Institute of Aerospace Technology), INTA, is a nano-satellite which weighs 22&nbsp;kg. Its main mission is the communication between remote sites like the Antarctic, the Hesperides warship and Spain.
The Nanosat-1B has fourteen sides, all of them covered by solar panels but the bottom one where the following antennas are installed: a medium gain UHF four wire antenna and two patch antennas.
On the top side there are four UHF monopoles. The solar sensors and the Vectorsol experiment are located in the middle tray, being all the other equipment and experiments located inside the satellite.
The Nanosat-1B covers all the earth due to his polar orbit and it stores scientific data which are unloaded when the satellite passes the Control Centre vertical (located at INTA, Torrejon, Madrid) and the mobile stations '''(Nano-Terminals)'''.
This satellite was launched on 29Th of July 2009 at  18:46 h.  UTC from de    Cosmodromo    in Baikonur (Kazajistan), launch pad 95 area 109, by a Dnepr-1 rocket along with other five satellites : the DubaiSat-1 (this one being the main load), Deimos-1, UK-DMC 2, Aprizesat-3 and Aprizesat-4. 
Besides their weight and size characteristics, the Nano-satellites are a new concept of design for space system and a great opportunity to reach space at lower development cost and time. The Nanosat Program foresees several new launches with precise applications, as these platforms are particularly suitable for in orbit demonstration missions including instruments, components and supporting technologies for bigger Space Programs.
