Lakeview Middle School is located in western Orange County in the city of Winter Garden.  Lakeview was originally built in 1927 and served as a junior-senior high school for approximately 500 students.  In 1975, West Orange High School opened and Lakeview became a junior high school.  In 1986, Orange County Public Schools converted all junior high schools into middle schools, and Lakeview customized its curriculum to reflect this change in philosophy and structure.  In 1995, a new , state of the art media center and a new guidance suite were completed to enhance the academic environment for all Lakeview students.  During the 2002-2003 school year Lakeview celebrated the addition of a technologically state of the art academic building, performing arts center and cafeteria.  Our renovated main building was reopened in August 2003.  In the spring of 2005, we opened our new gymnasium.
