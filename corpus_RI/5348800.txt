The FTOPS consists of multiple tournaments in a variety of different poker games, each of which is hosted by a different Full Tilt professional.  FTOPS I consisted of eight Texas Hold 'em and Omaha Hold 'em tournaments, but the series has since expanded to include Stud, Razz, and mixed games, as well as knockout bounty, shootout, cashout, short-handed, and heads up tournaments.  With the FTOPS XIII in August 2009, Full Tilt added a charity event to the series to benefit Ante Up for Africa, hosted by Don Cheadle.  The main event was a $500 buy in No Limit Holdem tournament for FTOPS I to XV and is now $600 from FTOPS XVI.
The series features a number of ongoing challenges that reward players for certain feats, such as winning 30 hands without showdown.  Players who make the final table are awarded an FTOPS jacket, and event winners are awarded an FTOPS gold jersey and an FTOPS gold jersey avatar to represent them at Full Tilt   s tables.  At the FTOPS XV in February 2010, any player who makes the money in 17 of the 27 events will receive a $1 million bonus.  
Full Tilt also sponsors a Mini FTOPS, which takes place one month later and features the same events at 1/10 the buy-in.
