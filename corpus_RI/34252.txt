Orange County is bordered on its east by the Sabine River - the border with Louisiana, on its southeast by the Gulf of Mexico, on its west by Jefferson County - its parent county, and on its north by three different counties of Texas. Also on its northwestern border is the Neches River. 
The biggest building in Orange County is the West Orange-Stark Elementary School, built in 2010. See West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School District.
The geography of Orange County varies relatively little, with an elevation that reaches 33 feet (10 meters) above sea level at very few points within the county. Orange County is very flat, and its soil is quite sandy, as could be expected in a county along the Gulf of Mexico. (Sandy soil is also common in southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, and in western and southern Florida.) There are saltwater marshes in much of the southeastern part of Orange County that borders the Sabine River. There are piney woods (sometimes capitalized) in the northern part of the county.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Orange County has a total area of 380&nbsp;square miles (983&nbsp;km  ), of which  356&nbsp;square miles (923&nbsp;km  ) is land and 23&nbsp;square miles (60&nbsp;km  ) (6.10%) is water.
Orange County was formed in 1852 from portions of Jefferson County. It was named after the orange fruit, the common citrus fruit grown by the early settlers of this County near the mouth of the Sabine River.
Due to periodic spells of quite cold winter weather (frosts) in Orange County, it is no longer the home of orange trees and citrus orchards. The production of those fruits in Texas long ago was moved a long way southwest into the Rio Grande Valley, where the weather is almost always warm all winter long. Citrus trees produce their fruit in the wintertime, which makes them especially vulnerable to frost and icy weather.  
A similar thing has happened in the State of Florida, where orchards of citrus trees no longer exist in either Citrus County or Orange County, Fla. because of bad winter freezes in some years. In both Florida and Texas, the citrus agriculture has been moved farther south in search of milder winters, and away from the periodic frosts.
During World War II, Orange County was the home of a large amount of shipbuilding for the navies the United States and allied countries.

During the war, the Consolidate Steel Corporation employed as many as 20,000 people at its shipyard in Orange, Texas.
