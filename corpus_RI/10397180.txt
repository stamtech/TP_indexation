The first phase of Desert Edge was new construction completed in 2002.http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/energysmartschools/ess_desert-edge_cs.pdf
The second phase of the structure, a  expansion, was built by Adolfson and Peterson Construction and completed in 2005. It received LEED Silver certification, making Desert Edge Arizona's first LEED-certified public high school and the fourth in the United States. It included new classrooms and a free-standing fine arts center. This expansion was completed four weeks ahead of schedule and $450,000 under budget.
The result of this is that the district saves $58,000 annually in energy costs and uses one million gallons of water a year compared to a traditional high school. The Agua Fria Union High School District's fourth high school, Verrado High School (opened 2006), has a similar LEED certification. Since then, Desert Edge and Verrado have also received solar panel installs, which will be forthcoming to the other high schools in the district by September 2011. It is estimated that some 40 percent of the entire district's energy needs will come from these solar panels upon completion.
The campus, largely for its environmentally-friendly features, has won the following awards:
