The '''Convention Center Light Rail Stop''' is one of 33 stops on the Baltimore Light Rail. It is located adjacent to the Baltimore Convention Center for which it is named, and is also near the entrance to Oriole Park at Camden Yards as well as the Sports Legends at Camden Yards museum. Though the Camden Yards Light Rail Stop is considered to be the stop for the stadium, fans attending games at the stadium can also use this stop.
The Convention Center stop was originally called '''Pratt Street''', named for the crossing street by that name.
