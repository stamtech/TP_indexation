In January 2009 the Obama inaugural committee released a print produced by Shepard Fairey on behalf of Obama's inauguaration. 10,000 prints were produced and the first 1,000 are numbered and signed by Fairey. The signed and numbered prints were sold by the Obama Inaugural Committee for $500, while the unsigned and unnumbered prints were sold for $100.
Many of the Artist for Obama prints were bought by investors who bought multiple copies of each poster. After the prints sold out, they then subsequently resold the prints usually over ebay at a several hundred percent profit. Immediately after Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election prices for the prints skyrocketed.  The prices have since decreased and stabilized.
