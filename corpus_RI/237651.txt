AltaVista was created by researchers at Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory who were trying to provide services to make finding files on the public network easier.
At launch, the service had two innovations which set it ahead of the other search engines; It used a fast, multi-threaded crawler (Scooter) which could cover many more Web pages than were believed to exist at the time and an efficient search running back-end on advanced hardware. As of 1998, it used 20 multi-processor machines using DEC's 64-bit Alpha processor. Together, the back-end machines had 130 GB of RAM and 500 GB of hard disk space, and received 13 million queries per day. This made AltaVista the first searchable, full-text database of a large part of the World Wide Web. The distinguishing feature of AltaVista was its minimalistic interface compared with other search engines of the time; a feature which was lost when it became a portal, but was regained when it refocused its efforts on its search function.
AltaVista's site was an immediate success.  Traffic increased steadily from 300,000 hits on the first day to more than 80 million hits a day two years later.  The ability to search the web, and AltaVista's service in particular, became the subject of numerous articles and even some books.  AltaVista itself became one of the top destinations on the web, and by 1997 would earn US$50 million in sponsorship revenue.
In 1996, AltaVista became the exclusive provider of search results for Yahoo!.  In 1998, Digital was sold to Compaq and in 1999, Compaq redesigned AltaVista as a web portal, hoping to compete with Yahoo!.  Under CEO Rod Schrock, AltaVista abandoned its streamlined search page and focused on features like shopping and free email.
In June 1999, Compaq sold a majority stake in AltaVista to CMGI, an internet investment company.
In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by Overture Services, Inc.
In July 2003, Overture itself was taken over by Yahoo!.
In December 2010, a Yahoo employee leaked PowerPoint slides that the search engine would be shut down as part of a consolidation at Yahoo.
AltaVista provides a free translation service, branded Babel Fish, which automatically translates text between several languages. In May 2008, this service was re-branded as a part of Yahoo!.
