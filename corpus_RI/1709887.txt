The '''Volvo China Open''' is a men's golf tournament that has been held annually in China since 1995. The event is organised by the China Golf Association and has been co-sanctioned by the European Tour since 2003.
Through 2008, the Volvo China Open also featured on the Asian Tour schedule, but this changed in 2009 with the announcement of the OneAsia Tour, a new golf tour setup by the CGA in association with the PGA Tour of Australasia, the Japan Golf Tour, the Korean PGA and the Korean Golf Association. Having been involved in the early stages the Asian Tour withdrew from OneAsia, the result being that four events, the China Open, Pine Valley Beijing Open, Korea Open and China Classic, were removed from the schedule having been announced as founding events of the new tour. In addition the Asian Tour stated that they would not allow their members to play in those events unless already qualified via membership of the European Tour, promising stiff penalties for those that ignored this ruling.
The European Tour sanctions several events in Asia, and has made a particular effort to expand its coverage in the Chinese market.
