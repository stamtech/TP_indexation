  Prior to the 2004 WSOP, Coach was a regular poker player around Thousand Oaks, CA and worked part time at various poker tournaments around the city.  At the 2004 WSOP, Coach was employed as a "Chip Runner."  "To get to any final table, let alone the World Series, is an accomplishment that goes beyond anything else in poker," the Coach said. "I saw light at the end of the tunnel when I got (heads-up against Pockat), but the light turned out to be a train."
Coach's lifetime winnings exceed $83,000.
