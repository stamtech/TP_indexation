Hi all -- I'm supposed to have another computer connect to my port 8080 (my computer is apparently acting like a server). How do they do this? I know my IP address. Is it :8080? Is the colon right? Something else?
Thanks!

I don't think this has to do with proxies - I just think you want to allow a computer to talk some protocol to your port 8080.  You're right, the url will be with the colon as you say, eg http://:8080/path/document in the case that you have an http server running.  If they can't connect to you, then you should check the firewall / NAT settings between you and the client (maybe there's a router sitting there messing things up).

Is there a program or something that displays the classified screen that is used on military computers when people enter the room that cannot see the screen.  I would like to use something like that when I lock my computer in Windows. --  ( ) 12:29, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I recently purchased a used hard drive.  I low-level formatted it using appropriate software from the manufacturer and installed Windows XP Home Edition on it.  For some reason, the boot.ini file contains entries for not only my XP installation, but also for a XP Pro installation and a Mac OS X installation.  Even after deleting the file and reformatting the hard drive the entries persist!  What do I do?   ( ) 13:08, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I can't even boot into Windows because of this problem.  The OS looks at the boot.ini file and can't find the XP Pro or Mac OS X installation and refuses to boot due to "a hardware configuration problem."  And i've tried re-installing already, and the entries keep coming back.  PS sorry about my terse reply, this problem has annoyed me for a while now and i am sick of it.

Doesn't the Recovery Console have a fixmbr option?  Will that work?   ( ) 13:03, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
Yes!  No more problems!  (I had to manually delete the invalid entries in safe mode though...)  Thanks everyone!   ( ) 13:05, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
I recently bought Ultimate 2007 to upgrade from the student version, but everytime I try to install it I get an error saying that it won't work. I also cannot unistal or repair the old version using control panel. I bought a new HDD and copied my old C drive onto that (using xxclone), could that have missed anything during the copying process?   ( ) 13:51, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
When you say manually deleting the old version, do you mean deleting it off of C:\ and removing the registry entries for office?   ( ) 16:21, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
It's now sorted! If anyone else does have the same problem, microsoft have made a very good guide , just make sure you follow it exactly as it says.   ( ) 19:02, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I am planning to buy a new laptop, but I want one that will run Ubuntu without too much trouble.
If I test my new laptop with the Live CD and it works, is it  sure that the installation will work?     16:25, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

Last Christmas I got a brand new  compact component system. I've noticed that plenty of my CD's (today its my copy of The Stone Roses) don't play properly on it. The first song or two will have an annoying crackling and popping effect almost exactly like that which can be heard on old beat up vinyl albums. As the album plays it progressively gets worse until the album is deemed not readable by the system and it just stops playing. The CDs themselves are in perfect condition, I purchased them myself and they are not CD-Rs. The only way to get around this problem is to play them in my 10+ year old PC with a generic brand CD-ROM drive my friend gave me for free, which instantly plays all of them perfectly. This ancient drive which was given to me by someone who was about to throw it away plays albums better than a brand new $170 compact component system. It annoys me because now the sound has to go through the crappy sound card of my PC. Sometimes if I keep trying over and over my stereo will eventually read the disc right, but this becomes absurdly frustrating. I've had enough so today I decided that my options were either to ask the wiki reference desk or pull an Office Space and drag it in to a field and smash it. I realize that this is probably too vague a question and that it is tl;dr anyway so I don't really expect any responses.   ( ) 17:44, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
Can you get touch screen e-paper? If yes, is it multi-toutch? Thanks.  ( ) 20:08, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
Why do Americans call mobile phones, cell phones? It makes sense to call a phone "mobile" because it is actualy mobile, but "cell phones" aren't cellular, the only thing that is cellular is the phone network. Thanks.   ( ) 20:12, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I was playing around with thhis website using drupal running on wampserver 2.0. I upgraded winXP to server pack 3 and now I can't get to phpmyadmin anymore. anything localhost just turns up a typical browser error. I'm guessing I need to uninstall and reinstall the whole kit, but I don't want to lose my website. Is there any way I can at least export or save my database w/o doing it through phpmyadmin or a web browser at all? --  ( ) 21:07, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

Sounds like a homework question, or a gameshow trivia question.
I'd like to use my life line... To wikipedia!
I own a Vista laptop that has three languages in the Language Bar--"US", "Canadian French", and "Canadian Multilingual Standard". For some reason, once in awhile I guess I'll hit a key that will make the Language Bar automatically switch from the "US" setting to one of the other two, though I have no idea what key is doing this. I don't have a key that changes the language, so I must be accidently pressing a combination of keys which makes the language change? I'm not sure.--  ( ) 23:54, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I figured it out; Control-Shift changes the language. Thanks for the tips and help!--  ( ) 21:28, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
I was wondering if it was possible to add programs at startup, on Ubuntu, via the command line (terminal), I know I can do it , but I need to do this in the command line... any ideas?   ( ) 23:38, 7 October 2008 (UTC)
I think you can do this by linking to the script in /etc/rc.local . But that's not what you're looking for   ( ) 14:15, 8 October 2008 (UTC)
