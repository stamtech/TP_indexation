Piotr, would you object if the map view was from above rather than the side as it is now? Even rotating the image that way would make it our own, and closer to not having to worry about copyright. Let me know what you think. Krzyzszek   ( ) 04:18, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

I know its probably a real tall order to integrate all of the methods into a colored map; so I'm thinking it may be better and easier to have a map of the 1st 5, and then a map of the method(s) of those states that have legal provisions on the books for it. Thanx,   ( ) 19:57, 9 February 2008 (UTC)

It was a bit tricky and the adjusted version isn't perfect, but it is an improvement (I think).  I selected the ocean and clouds from the hue and saturation channels in the image with a feather select, inverted the selection to get the islands, and reduced the blue channel to make the islands less hazy.  Some of the clouds (especially down in the bottom left) aren't quite right though.  Btw, there was a larger version available from the NASA website so I uploaded that one as well, then uploaded the modification over it.  I think that might have been a mistake because Mediawiki's refusing to show the new version but it'll probably sort itself out eventually.    ( ) 12:55, 8 March 2008 (UTC)

To understand why each country support or is oppose to Kosovian independance, it may be great to add the a/ "explosion-icon" , b/ the name of the area : example "icone + Basque (under the icone, in small and half-translucid)" to localize local independentist movements (es:Basque, es:Catalona , fr:Corsica, ru:tchecheni , cn:tibet, etc, etc.).
Add small icons and mostly tranparent icons may be great because :
Many thanks for your help !
I strongly object to the addition of these "icones". There is something such as too much information, or bad information.  In this case, the map cannot possibly contain impartially, or in an easily verifiable and documented way, an indication of well over 200 ethnic/separatist conflicts around the world; furthermore, such a map is beside the point for a map that is supposed to indicate international recognition by ''states''.  Furthermore, assessing what constitutes an internal ethnic conflict vs. other kinds is laden with POV implications, as is also the exact placement of the conflict-designating "icone" in some places. And the present implementation includes an "icone" somewhere in Scotland (?!) and no indication of confllicts anywhere in Indonesia, which is curious. Best to leave this feature off. I will revert the graphic to last version showing just states, where, for great majorit of cases, simplified indication of boundaries on global maps is not POV-sensitive. Also, the legend already in wide use on many Wikipedias has no provision  the "icones". Incidentally, there is no such word as "icones". One ''icon'', two or more ''icons''. And we already have POV/OR issues with just indicating the ''color'' of the country in accordance with the legend actuallly used. Best wishes, --    18:06, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
