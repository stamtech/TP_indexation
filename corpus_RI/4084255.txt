The Corporation was founded in 1988 as American Mobile Satellite Corporation. Its acquisition of ARDIS was completed on March 31, 1998. In April 2000, the company changed its name to Motient Corporation, with its stock traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol "MTNT". MSV was formed by the integration of the spun-off satellite operations of Motient and TMI Communications and Company, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of BCE Inc. of Canada . The new company has operations in both America and Canada, providing service to both countries and the Caribbean. MSV changed its name to SkyTerra in December 2008. The company was traded Over-the-Counter and was listed on the OTCBB: SKYT. SkyTerra (formerly    Mobile Satellite Ventures   )  was the first company to receive a Federal Communications Commission license to deploy Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) technology.
In 2005, SkyTerra purchased 50% of Hughes Network Solutions, a subsidiary of the News Corp.-owned DirecTV Group, for $157.4 million, which SkyTerra held under its subsidiary Hughes Communications. In January 2006, DirecTV sold its remaining 50% share in Hughes Network Solutions to SkyTerra for $100 million. Hughes Communications was spun off as a separate company in February 2006, with SkyTerra divesting its entire stake in the company to its shareholders.
TerreStar Corporation, formerly Motient Corporation, was the controlling shareholder of TerreStar Networks Inc. and TerreStar Global Ltd., and a shareholder of SkyTerra Communications.
SkyTerra was acquired by Harbinger Capital Partners in March 2010 and became part of LightSquared in July 2010.
AMSC initially provided GEO based satellite services based on its MSAT satellite.
Most of current products and services are aimed at emergency services, law enforcement, and companies that specialize in transportation. However, MSV and Boeing are developing a satellite telephony network for consumers.
The use of Boeing's GeoMobile platform will allow for coverage of the entire United States with a single satellite. This new approach to satellite telephony has already been validated with the Thuraya network. MSV's satellite will use an even bigger antenna than the Thuraya spacecraft (at 22 meters in diameter, it will be the largest commercial reflector dish ever used in space), allowing it to communicate with phones no larger than modern cell phones thanks to the fact that the large antenna gain allows the handset to operate at a power output comparable to regular cell phones. This is now possible since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed satellite operators to create terrestrial cellular networks using spectrum previously restricted to satellite use.
This means that phones can be compatible with both the upcoming MSV satphone network and local cellular networks, allowing a user to communicate over the regular cellular network, and only rely on the satellites in areas outside the range of cell towers. MSV has earned  around this set-up. It will be useful in sparsely populated areas where the construction of cell towers is not cost-effective, as well as to emergency-response services which must remain operational even when the local cellular network is out of service.
The SkyTerra space segment consists of the MSAT geostationary satellites MSAT-1 and MSAT-2.
The SkyTerra2 satellite is scheduled for delivery in 2011.
