KFMB first greeted listeners on April 13, 1941, broadcasting from the corner of Pacific Highway and Ash Street, downtown. Owned by Warren B. Worchester and the Worchester Broadcasting Corporation, the "M" in KFMB was for Worchester's daughter Mary; the "B" for his son Warren Burnham. KFMB-AM started broadcasting at 1420&nbsp;kHz, then very soon moved to 1450&nbsp;kHz, and then 540&nbsp;kHz, but later switched to 760&nbsp;kHz after a re-alignment of broadcast channels between the United States and Mexico. Midwest Television Inc, headquartered in Champaign, Illinois, purchased KFMB-AM-FM-TV in 1964.
