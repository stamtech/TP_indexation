The Swedish Touring Car Championship was created in 1996 as a copy of the successful British Touring Car Championship. Nilsson founded Flash Engineering that year to compete in the championship. Volvo, which had been competing in the BTCC since 1994, partnered with the newly founded Halmstad-based racing team, and provided financial support and the cars. The team initially raced a Volvo 850, and moved to a S40 in 1998. In 2000, the team moved to Karlstad. The team raced a Volvo S60 from 2001 through the 2004 season. In 2005, Nilsson sold the team to Christian Dahl, who named it Polestar Racing. Nilsson kept the name "Flash Engineering" and formed a new, independent team, running BMW's. Porsche appointed Flash Engineering as promotor for the one make-series Carrera Cup Scandinavia in 2005.
Flash Engineering won the STCC-title in 2008 with Richard Goransson.  Jan Nilsson won the STCC in its inaugural season (1996), as well as 1997. Fredrik Ros won the 2006 Porsche Carrera Cup for Flash Engineering.
In 2010, the team ran two BMW 320si in the STCC and three cars in Carrera Cup Scandinavia. One BMW is driven by Nilsson, the other by Thed Bjork. Bjork finished fifth in 2010 and second overall in 2009 on the same points at champion Tommy Rustad after a controversial finish to the season. The team also races a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup in the Porsche Carrera Cup Scandinavia, driven by Prince Carl Philip of Sweden  who is a licensed race driver, one Porsche for Norwegian Roar Lindland and one Porsche shared by Linus Ohlsson and Matte Karlsson.
For 2011 the team is joined by BTCC 2009 champion Colin Turkington. The 28-year-old is going to drive a BMW 320si alongside team mate and team owner Jan "Flash" Nilsson. The team is also going to run three cars in Carrera Cup Scandinavia for Price Carl Philip, Roar Lindland and Matte Karlsson.
Flash Engineering is the official organiser of the Porsche one-make series Carrera Cup Scandinavia and the official Scandinavian Porsche Motorsport dealer. The team took over the series in 2005 when the series was close to bankruptcy. In 2009 the series became the biggest Carrera Cup-series in the world with 35 entries.
