I suspect this was written to advertise a defunct web page (http://www.yahoo-underground.com) which was designed to spread information about misbehaving on Yahoo's chat and game servers.  Even if it weren't, this page needs a lot of help even for a stub and I'm not sure much more could be done with it than already has.   06:39, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. '''Please do not edit this page'''.
