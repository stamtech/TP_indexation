In 2011, the United Kingdom had installed 77.8 MWp of photovoltaic capacity, three times as much as in the previous year, but still only representing 0.1% of total electricity production. Solar thermal capacity to supply hot water was expected to grow to 25 MWth in 2006.
 represented 0.3% of the European total of 3.4GWp.
Due to an EU agreement to generate 15% of electricity from renewables by 2020, in June 2008 a new programme to encourage homeowners to generate their own electricity was announced, which will include a feed-in tariff.
In August 2006 there was widespread news coverage in the United Kingdom of the major high street electrical retailers (Currys) decision to stock PV modules, manufactured by Sharp, at a cost of   1,000 per module. The retailer also provides an installation service.
The Energy Saving Trust that administers government grants for domestic photovoltaic systems, the Low Carbon Building Programme, estimates that an installation for an average-sized house would cost between   5,000-   8,000 per kWp installed, with most domestic systems usually between 1.5 and 3 kWp, and yield annual savings between   150 and   200.
The Green Energy for Schools programme will be providing 100 schools across the UK with solar panels. The first school in Wales was the Tavernspite School, near Whitland, which has received panels worth   20,000, sufficient to produce 3,000kWh of electricity each year.
Discussion on implementation of a feed-in tariff programme concluded on September 26, 2008, and the results will be published in the spring of 2009. One story used the language "They will be able to sell back surplus electricity at premium prices to the national grid.", which is not a feed-in tariff, it is simply a means of reconciling any surplus from a net metering programme. The key word is "surplus", not the word "sell". Net metering only requires the existing home electric meter, while a feed in tariff requires installation of a separate meter to measure generation. Australia has been criticized for implementing a similar programme, paying AU$0.60 (about   0.28) for each kWh over what is used each month, with Environment Victoria Campaigns Director Mark Wakeham calling it a "fake feed-in tariff".
The government in the UK agreed in April 2010 to pay for the surplus electricity at a rate of 41.3p per kWh (the whole electricity that is generated) and exported at 44.3p per kWh to the national grid.
