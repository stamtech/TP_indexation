The '''Duple Dominant''' was a design of coach bodywork built by Duple between 1972 and 1982. It had an all-steel structure.
Duple Dominant bodywork was built on different chassis types including:
The original design had a windscreen (and matching rear windows) of the same height as the side windows. It remained in production (with a new design of grille) alongside the Dominant II, whereafter it was known as the Dominant I.
The Dominant II (introduced in 1976) had a deeper windscreen, rectangular headlights and a flat rear window.
The Dominant III had shallow, parallelogram-shaped side windows. The Dominant IV had conventional-shaped side windows, but shallower than those on the Dominant II.
The '''Duple Goldliner''' was a high-floor version of the Dominant III or IV.
The '''Duple Dominant E''' was a bus-specification version of the Dominant I or II. It is not to be confused with the visually dissimilar '''Dominant Bus''' which was available from 1974 to 1987.
