The '''Santa Fe Community Convention Center''' is a  facility features flexible meeting spaces that can provide multiple, simultaneous events with their own exhibition area, breakout rooms and dining areas.  Opened in historic downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico in September 2008 as one of the most sustainable new convention centers in the United States, the convention center was awarded LEED Gold certification in December 2009 in recognition of its sustainable design and innovations. 
Designed by Fentress Architects, in association with Spears Architects, the Center fits seamlessly into the Pueblo Revival style of historic Santa Fe.  The world-class center is a civic icon that embraces the city   s    sense of place    while serving as a gathering place to share ideas that will shape the future.  
The center features a second-story green roof and multiple terraces that overlook an interconnected traditional southwestern courtyard.  All exterior timber was rescued from the Sierra Blanca forest fire and reused for the lentils, corbels and portals.  Green measures included recycling 88 percent of materials salvaged from the original demolished center and recycling 75 percent of on-site construction waste.  Extensive daylighting throughout public and meeting spaces conserves energy and connects visitors with the natural environment.
