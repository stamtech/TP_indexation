When a user visits one of the websites using Disqus and posts a comment, the comment is submitted to Disqus. If the user has a Disqus account, then it tracks all their comments across the websites that use Disqus. The required use of Disqus has raised privacy concerns about the ability to post comments anonymously. Disqus has also been heavily criticised for the poor quality of its software, which is often released without adequate testing.
Recently the ''Wired magazine'' website, Engadget, CNN, Fox News Channel, and ''Daily Telegraph'' have started using Disqus for comments.  Disqus allows logging in with a Yahoo profile but requires access to user's Yahoo contacts, status, and updates.  Using a Facebook profile requires even more information which is labeled as "basic information" but includes name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, and any other information users have shared with everyone.
