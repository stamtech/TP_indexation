Vinogradov is married and has three children. His hobbies include game sports, history of aviation and cosmonautics and astronomy.
Vinogradov graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute in 1977. 
Vinogradov was awarded the Hero of the Russian Federation medal.
In 1977     1983 Vinogradov specialized in software development for automated interactive designing systems of recoverable vehicles, development of aerodynamics and aerodyne arrangement design models, computer graphics.In 1983 he started working for the Head Design Bureau of RSC Energia. He worked on flight procedure verification for Soyuz-TM and Buran spacecrafts, development of automated crew training systems. He has also participated in launch preparation of the Soyuz-TM, Buran spacecraft and Energia rockets.
He was selected for the cosmonaut program on March 3, 1992, and spent the next two years in training. From October 1992 to February 1994, he completed generic space training at GCTC. From May 1994 to February 1995, he completed advanced test-cosmonaut training. Vinogradov was the backup flight engineer for the Soyuz TM-22 flight, launched on September 3, 1995. He was assigned to the Soyuz TM-24 flight, but the entire crew was grounded when the flight commander, Gennadi Manakov, experienced heart problems.
Vinogradov flew as the flight engineer on Soyuz TM-26 on August 5 1997 with cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev to the Mir space station. After two days of autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked with Mir on August 7. The crew repaired the power cable and harness/connectors in the severely damaged ''Spektr'' module and restored much of the lost power. They also repaired and replaced the oxygen generators in Mir. Vinogradov, Solovyev along and ESA astronaut Leopold Eyharts returned to Earth on February 19, 1998. The Soyuz capsule landed 30 km of Arkalyk at 09:10 UTC. During the mission, Vinogradov spent 197 days, 17 hours, and 34 minutes in space.  
In January 2004 Vinogradov began training as the ISS Expedition13 crew commander. The mission was launched aboard the Soyuz TMA-8 with Vinogradov and NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams from the Baikonour Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 29, 2006. Vinogradov served as the Soyuz commander. After two days of solo flight, Soyuz TMA-8 docked with the ISS on March 31, 2006. During their mission, Vinogradov and Williams hosted two NASA shuttle crews during their stay on board the ISS.  visited the ISS between 6-15 July, 2006. The main purposes of STS-121 were to test new safety and repair techniques introduced following the ''Columbia'' disaster as well as to deliver supplies, equipment and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter from Germany to the ISS. Space Shuttle  brought the P3/P4 truss and its solar wings to the ISS during its STS-115 mission from September 9 to 21. The Soyuz capsule carrying Vinogradov undocked from the ISS at 5:53 p.m. EDT on September 28, 2006, and landed in the steppes of Kazakhstan near Arkalyk at 9:13 p.m. EDT. Vinogradov was joined by NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Spaceflight Participant Anousheh Ansari. Vinogradov spent 182 days, 23 hours and 44 minutes in space on board the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS.
Vinogradov has conducted six spacewalks during his cosmonaut career. Five of this spacewalks were in 1997 and 1998 during his stay on board the Mir space station. His EVA time through six spacewalks is 31 hours and 47 minutes.
On August 22, 1997, Vinogradov completed his career spacewalk. He and fellow cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyov began their spacewalk at 11:14 UTC. During the excursion the two spacewalkers, connect power cables, inspected damage on the ''Spektr'' module and retrieved equipment. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 16 minutes.
On October 20, 1997, Vinogradov conducted his second career spacewalk inside the ''Spektr'' module, with Anatoly Solovyov. The duo began their spacewalk at 09:40 UTC. The spacewalk ended at 16:18 UTC. The duration of the spacewalk was 6 hours and 38 minutes.
On November 3, 1997, Vinogradov completed his third career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The two dismantled solar panels and deployed Sputnik 40. The spacewalk began at 03:32 UTC and ended at 09:36 UTC. The excursion lasted 6 hours and 4 minutes.
On November 6, 1997, Vinogradov completed his fourth career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The two spent the entire EVA installing solar panels. The spacewalk began at 00:12 UTC and ended at 06:24 UTC. The excursion lasted 6 hours and 12 minutes.
On January 8, 1998m Vinogradov completed his fifth career spacewalk, again with Anatoly Solovyov. The duo retrieved equipment and repaired leaking EVA hatch. The spacewalk began at 23:08 UTC and ended at 02:14 UTC. The excursion lasted 3 hours and 6 minutes.
On June 2, 2006, Vinogradov performed his sixth career spacewalk. Vinogradov and NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams spent six hours and 31 minutes making repairs and collecting experiments along the space station's exterior. Their excursion lasted almost an hour longer than planned after the astronauts fell behind in their work schedule. The two spacewalkers began their spacewalk at 22:48 GMT, when they stepped outside the ''Pirs'' docking compartment airlock. The spacewalking duo completed two key ISS repairs. Vinogradov replaced a clogged vent nozzle used to dump excess hydrogen overboard by the space station's Elektron oxygen generator. Vinogradov and Williams also replaced a broken video camera that provides key views from the space station's railcar-like Mobile Base System. During the spacewalk, Vinogradov watched a foot restraint adapter, which had previously linked him to the station's Strela crane, drift off into space. The spacewalk ended at 1:19 a.m. EDT when the two spacewalkers re-entered the airlock of the ''Pirs'' docking compartment.
Vinogradov was slated to hit a golf ball into space during the spacewalk as part of an agreement between Russia's Federal Space Agency and the Canadian golf equipment firm Element 21 Golf Co. However, it was canceled.
