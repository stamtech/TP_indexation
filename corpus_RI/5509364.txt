GSM is a standard for mobile phones in the world. Its promoter, the GSM Association, estimates that 82% of the global mobile market uses the standard.  GSM is used by over 2 billion people across more than 212 countries and territories.
It provides secure voice and data wireless communications. The SGSM works alongside the Secure Wireline Terminal (SWT) to provide a worldwide secure mobile environment.  The SWT does not use GSM, but instead connects to a PSTN phone socket to allow office to remote user connection without the need for GSM phones inside buildings.
Another wireless product is Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cell phone used for high assurance, end-to-end encrypted, secure voice and data communications. The phone is capable of communicating at levels up to and including Top Secret, with proper user authorization and the appropriate encryption key.
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for voice and data, replaced the older Data Encryption Standard (DES); was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002.
