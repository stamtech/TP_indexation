The '''Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center''' is a convention center in downtown Anchorage, Alaska. The $111 million,  facility opened in September 2008, early and within budget. The Dena   ina Center increases Anchorage   s civic and convention capacity by 300 percent, and offers visitors an opportunity to learn about the Dena'ina people who have lived in the Cook Inlet Region since just after the last Ice Age. The meeting rooms and other areas of the Dena   ina Center have Athabascan names, colors throughout the building reflect the colors of the area   s changing season and the artwork within the building tells the story of the Dena   ina people   today and in the past.
The center is used for conventions, trade shows, meetings and other events, including concerts. 
The Dena'ina center is used in conjunction with The Egan Civic & Convention Center and the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts. These three facilities form the Anchorage Convention District and are joined by heated sidewalks.
