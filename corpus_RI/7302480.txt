Backing onto the scenic South Saskatchewan River, the library is located across the street from the Esplanade Arts and Heritage Centre and next to the Court of Queen   s Bench on First Street S.E. in downtown Medicine Hat.
The dual-level facility, renovated in 2008, features a children   s library, dedicated young adult section, adult fiction, movies, music and audio books on the upper level.  The main checkout, self-checkout kiosks and the Information & Memberships counter are located on this level as well.
The lower level is home to the reference collection, adult non-fiction, periodicals, microfilm readers and public computer terminals.  The 180 seat theatre and both the Honor Currie and Legion meeting rooms are also found on this level.
The City of Medicine Hat installed a one kilowatt solar electric system on the roof of the library during the summer of 2006.  The building now draws part of its electricity from the solar panel.
The amount of elecricity generated can also be viewed in real time.
