Emilie Benes earned a fine arts degree at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, United States.  After marrying, she sculpted for 25 years while raising a family, then had her first solo show in 1981 in Washington, D.C. 
Since the 1980s, most of her works have been in wood. Her monumental 1993 work "Lintel", constructed from cut cherry trees and then cast in bronze, is in the collection of Grounds for Sculpture, a  sculpture park and museum in New Jersey. She exhibited in the 2003 Florence Biennale and participated by invitation in the 2005 Vancouver International Sculpture Biennale.
Shortly after graduating from Wellesley, Emilie Benes, herself a grandniece of Czechoslovakia's former president Edvard Benes,  married Zbigniew Brzezinski, a political scientist who served as an adviser to President Carter. The Brzezinskis have three children.  A daughter, Mika Brzezinski, is a television journalist, political commentator, and co-host for MSNBC. Their son, Mark Brzezinski, is a lawyer who has served as an adviser to President Clinton and President Obama.
