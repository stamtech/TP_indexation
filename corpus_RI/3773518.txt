The 29th District covers a diverse assortment of Republican-leaning suburbs in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. It contains portions of three counties, including both the San Gabriel Foothills and both sides of the hill ranges separating Orange and Los Angeles Counties.
Over half of the district's population lives in Los Angeles County. This includes over two dozen cities and unincorporated areas from La Crescenta-Montrose to Diamond Bar. The district's Foothill cities include Arcadia, Monrovia, Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne, and Claremont. The southern tier contains Walnut and La Habra Heights and the unincorporated areas of Rowland Heights and Hacienda Heights. Two cities in San Bernardino County are also adjacent to this tier: Chino and Chino Hills.
The remainder of the district is in Orange County, north of the 91 freeway. In contrast to the Los Angeles County portion, just four cities and a sliver of a fifth are in the district. The entirety of Brea, Yorba Linda, La Habra, and Placentia are in the district, along with a small portion of Anaheim, in the Anaheim Foothills stretching toward Riverside County.
Reflecting the relative growth rates between Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, redistricting shifted the 29th toward the southeast. In 1991, the 29th was located entirely in Los Angeles County. In 2001, almost half of the district's population, predominantly in Whittier, Covina, and West Covina on the western edge, were removed in favor of the Orange and San Bernardino County areas.
