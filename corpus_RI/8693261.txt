Anderson previously wrote 28 popular biographies about Princess Diana, Barbra Streisand, the Kennedys, and the Bush family, among others.  ''Barack and Michelle'' describes the Obamas' marriage as being difficult for several years, as Barack left his accomplished wife, Michelle, to care for children and household, himself turning away from a lucrative legal career to pursue his political ambitions with little success or income.  The couple grew closer, according to the book, beginning in 2001 after the sickness of their daughter, Sasha, and Obama's growing political success.
The book is in part a compilation of previously published accounts and Obama's own memoirs.  It has been described as a "glowing" portrait of the Obamas, and characterizing their marriage as "solid". Andersen claimed he also interviewed 200 friends and relatives of the Obamas in Chicago, Hawaii, and Indonesia, but not the Obamas themselves. The book also contains a number of claims about the private lives of Barack and Michelle Obama, many not widely known or not generally accepted as of the date of publication, and some based on anonymous sources.
