The mayor of the municipality is Jeffrey Donson of the NPP. The NPP took control of the council following the controversial floor-crossing window in September 2007. The NPP is led by controversial Cape Town city councillor Badih Chabaan who is accused of corruption in offering monetary and patronage bribes to Western Cape councillors to cross the floor to join his new party. The previous coalition of the DA and  ICOSA collapsed when 2 ICOSA and 3 ANC councillors crossed the floor giving the NNP 5 seats out of 9 in the council or an outright majority (the only such council in SA that is governed by this fledgling new party). The previous DA/ICOSA coalition took power in August 2006 when the short-lived ANC-led coalition pact with the DA collapsed. The ANC/DA coalition had taken power after the local government elections in March 2006 local government elections. The DA refuses to recognize the new NPP-led council administration as it alleges that the 2 ICOSA defectors were sacked prior to the floor-crossing window being open and is currently challenging the council recomposition in the Cape High Court. As such its former mayor has refused to "step down" pending the outcome of the case, a prospect that the uncertainty and instability of this beleaguered council will continue. Kannaland has been beset by mismanagement and corruption since the ANC took control of the council in March 2001 when the single PAC councillor withdrew his support for a short-lived DA-led coalition that took power after the December 2000 local government elections. In 2011 the auditor-general declared that he could not give a clear statement about the financial situation in the municipality because the records are missing and no one seemed to know where they were.. After almost a decade of financial problems an attempt to restore order was underway in 2011
