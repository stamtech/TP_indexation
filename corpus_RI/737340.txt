When Yahoo! acquired BuzzTracker, the founder of BuzzTracker, Alan Warms, joined Yahoo! as the general manager and vice president of Yahoo! News. Yahoo! commented on BuzzTracker after the acquisition, saying, "Alan and the folks at BuzzTracker have come up with a way to spotlight the hottest information and give users a tool that makes the information easily digestible." No price was disclosed for the acquisition, but it is believed to be in the single-digit millions, around US$5 million. After the acquisition, Forbes commented on Yahoo!'s rivalry with competing companies Google and Digg, saying, "This will also move  into Google News and Digg territory, while Google is trying to move into the human-editorial side with the AP/AFP/PA deal announced last month." Several months after Yahoo! acquired BuzzTracker, the website has still yet to be integrated into Yahoo! News.
