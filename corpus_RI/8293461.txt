In 1979, John Hall, the founder of Brooklin Models, decided to move his wife Jenny and family back to England where he had been born and raised.  This is where Brooklin Models continues business to this day.  The impact of the move made models previously constructed in Canada instantly more valuable and sought after.  In 1998, after John Hall's retirement, Nigel Parker and Tim Fulford purchased the company (Olson 2006).
The Brooklin factory covers  on two floors and employs 25 people in Bath (Brooklin, 1994).
A brass master is carefully made by hand out of sheet brass by a skilled model maker taking hundreds of hours. When the brass master is complete a rubber mold is made for the various parts that will be needed in making the finished model (also see Route 66).
A special alloy of white metal, based heavily on tin but containing some lead, is used.  Exacting measures are followed.  The alloy is brought to a specific temperature, poured into the rubber molds at a specific speed, to set for a specific time.  Models are cast one at a time.
After being cast, the parts are carefully removed from the molds. Flashing is carefully removed and the parts are then prepared for either painting or chrome plating.  The windows are vac-u-formed.  Tires are made of a special rubber compound and all parts are readied for assembly.  The models are assembled by hand and any additional painting such as tail lights is done.
In 1996 a promotion was announced where if a collector bought eight Brooklin Models, and completed a collector card, a special limited edition 1946 Lincoln Continental redesigned by Raymond Loewy, could be purchased for the same price as a standard issue.
In 2004, the company celebrated its 30th anniversary with several special edition vehicles.  One of the celebration vehicles was the 1936 Pierce-Arrow Silver Arrow.
As of the end of 2006, over 120 different American cars, light trucks and trailers, in over 600 varieties, have been created by Brooklin Models, representing American cars and light trucks of the 1930s through 1960s (Mateo 2007).
Starting a trend, Brooklin added the Lansdowne range of British vehicles in 1993.  These were seven distinct models designed by John Martin and John Hammick, including such vehicles as the Austin Healey Sprite (John and Jenny Hall's first car), the Vauxhall Cresta, and MG Magnette, thus cars of traditional British marques became important to Brooklin in addition to American cars.  Ten more Lansdowne models were introduced by 1996 (Brooklin 1994; Brooklin 1996).  Sporting as well as saloon models appeared in the Lansdowne range, which was made to reminisce classic 1950s models made by Dinky Toys.
At the same time, the Robeddie line was introduced, consisting of twelve separate replicas of Swedish Volvos and Saabs, from a 1946-1950 Volvo PV60 sedan to a 1973 Volvo 144GL (Brooklin 1994, 20-22; Brooklin 1996; Johnson 1998, 31-32;).  According to the Brooklin website, as of 2010, this range has been discontinued.
About the turn of the century, several different lines were introduced which mainly represented a breaking of the extensive and complex numbers of vehicles into convenient groupings.  These were 'Brooklin' (the traditional American vehicles range), 'Lansdowne' (British vehicles), 'Robeddie' (Swedish vehicles), 'The Buick Collection' (Buicks from 1934-1939), 'US Model Mint' (Pickups, trucks, and trailers from the United States), 'Community Service Vehicles' (Fire, Ambulance, and hearses), 'International Police Vehicles', 'Rod 43rd' (selected vehicles customized as Hot Rods - a surprising departure from the regular Brooklin style), and most recently, the 'Old Lawnmower Company' (a new line - representing both manual and powered).
Over the course of Brooklin's history, many customizers have emerged who take commissions from Brooklin customers to paint and detail standard Brooklin models into specialized one-of-a-kind renditions.  These Code II and Code III models are treasured by collectors and valued on the marketplace.  John Roberts is  probably the best-known Brooklin customizer; his work is officially acknowledged by Brooklin.  Other prominent Brooklin customizers are Fred Lewis, John White, and Greg Gunn.
