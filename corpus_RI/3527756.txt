At the completion of its sixth season, the Tour expanded outside of Ontario for the first time, holding qualifying tournaments in British Columbia.  Players can also compete on the internet, as the ''Red Club Room'' offers tournaments through PartyPoker.
The Season 7 Tournament of Champions winner was the first champion to be rewarded with a buy-in to a $10,000 tournament, in this case the Main Event of the World Series of Poker.  The Season 8 prize was a buy-in to the $10,000 Main Event at the second annual World Poker Tour North American Poker Championship at Fallsview Casino.  For Season 10, the winner was given a choice of one of three World Poker Tour tournaments, and wound up playing at the LA Poker Classic.
To start Season 11, Red Hot announced they would be sponsored by the World Poker Tour, and all of its online games would be played at WorldPokerTour.com.
Season 12 featured a new sponsor: PartyPoker.  Over the next three season, with PartyPoker's support, Red Hot will qualify 20 players to play in one of the preliminary events at the 2009 World Series of Poker.
Tournaments are played at 8-man tables.  Each player is given 4000 chips to start: 12 red chips worth 25 each, 7 blues worth 100 each, and 6 greens worth 500 each.  Black chips (worth 1000), yellow/pink chips (worth 5000), and purple chips (worth 10000) are all used later in the tournament.  In addition, for every five dollars that a player spends at the bar (for food or drink) they receive one white chip.  A white chip is equal to the value of the small blind at the time, up until the 500/1000 level, where they are chipped out of play.
Players receive 25 points for each tournament they play.  Additionally, all players who make the final table receive bonus points:
1st place: 1000
2nd place: 700
3rd place: 500
4th place: 400
5th place: 300
6th place: 200
7th place: 125
8th place: 75
