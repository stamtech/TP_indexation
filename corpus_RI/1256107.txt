Originally, Padraig refused to play in Late Night Poker, as he did not wish to have his cards shown to the audience. His mood changed when money was added to the prize pool, and sponsorship also became a factor. In his heat, Padraig was actually the favourite with 2/1 odds against series 3 champion Phil Hellmuth's 5/2 odds. Despite this, Padraig bet on Ken Lennaard (who finished 2nd) at 6/1. Despite the fact that Hellmuth admitted he could see Padraig's cards during the heat, Padraig went on to win.
Padraig still plays numerous tournaments and has money finishes in both the World Poker Tour and European Poker Tour. In December 2009 he was the winner of the inaugural event of the United Kingdom & Ireland Poker Tour in his home town of Galway for    125,000. He also finds time to commentate on poker events including the Poker Nations Cup and the PartyPoker.com Football & Poker Legends Cup.
As of 2010 his total live tournament winnings exceed $1,610,000. His 8 cashes at the WSOP account for $780,031 of those winnings.
