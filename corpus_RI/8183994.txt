The first employee's tournament was not won because Alizadeth outplayed his opponents, but rather because of a deal.  With four players left (Dave Alizadeth, Von Huang, Tom Harper and Keith Watkins) a deal was reached declaring Alizadeth the winner.  According to initial reports, the deal was only achieved because "a World Series bracelet was not available for negotiation, the players decided to take their money and go home."  Other sources, however, indicate that the event was always intended to a bracelet event.  Either way, the official WSOP standings, credits Alizadeth with winning a WSOP bracelet at this event.
After winning the bracelet, Alizadeth made the money in several low limit tournaments such as the Spring Pot of Gold Poker Tournament and the 2001 Peppermill Spring Poker Tournament. 
Alizadeth's lifetime winnings exceed $24,000.
