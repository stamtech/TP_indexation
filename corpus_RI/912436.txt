As part of Yahoo!'s celebration of its tenth anniversary last week, it featured Wikipedia in a look back at the history of the internet over the past ten years.
In what Yahoo called a "", the company presented 100 snapshots of various events involving the internet since 1995. These naturally emphasized Yahoo's own corporate history, but also took the time to explore many internet phenomena, including both the purely ephemeral as well as more durable institutions.
Wikipedia was placed at number 75 on the list, although the order was not intended as a type of ranking, but rather followed a roughly chronological pattern. This fell right in between a commemoration of the MP3 format and a note about the failures of Webvan and Kozmo.com during the dot-com crash.
The item on Wikipedia featured an image of the newly designed portal at www.wikipedia.org (see  ). The accompanying text read: "Merging collaboration and reference, Wikipedia launches a web encyclopedia in '01--letting anyone write and edit entries. Despite concerns about accuracy, the online world embraces the free-content model, adding over a million entries by '05." It also linked to an article in Wired News from January, Daniel Terdiman's "".
