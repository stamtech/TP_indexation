Uploaded three times (deleted two of them as duplicates), see the uploaders . First it was just tagged as self made, the nex attempt said "A friend took it" and finaly a myspace page is cited as the source, wich in turn credit the image to http://www.photomistress.com (wich is also consistent with the watermark in the lower right corner). Basicaly at this point it's less than obvious that the uploader does in fact own the copyright to this image.     01:12, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

The uploader claims to have direct permission from the subject, and to have got the image from flickr . The same flickr user has uploaded other possibly unfree images, meaning this image may not actually be free, despite the flickr licenses it is published with. --    05:58, 30 January 2009 (UTC)

Marshall said his small head shot phot in B/W or color  belongs to him, and so can be reproduced.  He commented also that all other photos, Burj and STower  were submitted to hundreds of media organizations in November 2008 by Gensler and media companies in USA and China.  Thus,  Photos have been reprinted in other countries and all are Public Domain.
