Mitchell was the 1986 U.S. Junior National Champion. He won the bronze medal at the 1990 United States Figure Skating Championships, but was not named to the World team, despite the U.S. having three spots to that competition. Instead, a medical bye was given to Christopher Bowman who withdrew from the competition with a back injury. 
Mitchell finished 4th at the 1991 United States Figure Skating Championships, again just missing a spot on the World team.
In 1992, he won a bronze medal at the United States Figure Skating Championships. The US had three spots for the team to the 1992 Winter Olympics. However, Mitchell was not placed on the team due to a medical bye given to Todd Eldredge.  Mitchell competed at the 1992 World Figure Skating Championships, where he placed 5th, ahead of Eldredge.  
In 1993, he finished 2nd at the United States Figure Skating Championships, and was selected for the World team.  At Worlds, he received a perfect score of 6.0 for presentation in his short program, and was in 2nd place after this portion  of the competition behind Kurt Browning.  In the free skate, he fell to 4th place overall, and as a result, the United States had two spots for the 1994 Winter Olympics because the rules at that time required a country to medal at the previous year's World Championships to have three spots to the Olympics. This rule has since been amended.
After the 1993 Worlds, Mitchell moved to Milan, Italy to train with Carlo Fassi. Mitchell was vocal in his opposition to the reinstatement of professionals, such as Brian Boitano. Subsequently, at the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships he fell to 5th place and did not qualify for the 1994 Olympics.
Mitchell turned professional following the 1993-1994 season.  Throughout his amateur and professional career, Mitchell toured with Champions on Ice.
