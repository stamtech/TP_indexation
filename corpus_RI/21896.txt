Of its automobile brands, Volkswagen Passenger Cars is its mainstream marque, and the Group's major subsidiaries also include well-known car marques such as SEAT, Audi, Skoda, and the prestige marques Lamborghini, Bentley, and Bugatti.  The Group also has operations in commercial vehicles, owning Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, along with a controlling stake in Swedish truck and diesel engine maker Scania AB, and a 29.9% stake in MAN SE.

The company also wholly owns the Bundesliga football side VfL Wolfsburg. The company is also the shirt sponsor of Major League Soccer club D.C. United.
In August 2009, Porsche SE and Volkswagen Group reached an agreement that Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG would merge in 2011.
Volkswagen was founded on 28 May 1937 as the ''Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH''  ("Society for the preparation of the German People's Car", sometimes abbreviated to ''Gezuvor'') by the Nazi ''Deutsche Arbeitsfront''  (German Labour Front).  The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen Type 1, later better known as the Volkswagen Beetle.  On 16 September 1938, the company was renamed ''Volkswagenwerk GmbH''  ("Volkswagen Factory limited liability company").
During World War II the Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg primarily manufactured the military Kubelwagen (Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the VW Beetle.  Only a small number of Beetles were made during this time period.  The Wolfsburg plant also manufactured the V-1 (flying bomb), better known as the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.  Much of the workforce at the plant was slave labor, primarily from eastern Europe.
After the Second World War in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory, and tried to dismantle it and ship it home.  However, no British car manufacturer was interested; "the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car ... it is quite unattractive to the average buyer ... To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise".  In 1948, the Ford Motor Company was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president said he didn't think either the plant or the car was "worth a damn."  As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled.  Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.  The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948, the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, where it was managed by former-Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.
Production of the Type I Volkswagen Beetle started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s.  The company began introducing new models based on the Beetle, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform.  These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.
In 1960, upon the floatation of part of the German federal government's stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became ''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft'' (usually abbreviated to ''Volkswagenwerk AG'').
On 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz.  The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.
Another German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).
From the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym '''V.A.G''' was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, "V.A.G" had no official meaning.
On 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside of Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A..
In order to reflect the company's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the ''Volkswagenwerk'' in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again - to ''Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft'' (''Volkswagen AG'').
On 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.
In 1990 - after purchasing its entire equity - Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991 another step to the expansion of the group's activities was made through the signing of a joint venture partnership agreement with Skoda automobilova a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer, raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3% and the year after, on 11 December 1995, to 70% of its shares.
Three prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti.
On 30 May 2000, Volkswagen AG - after having gradually raised its equity share - turned Skoda Auto into a wholly owned subsidiary.
From 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group's automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with differentiated profile would be formed, the ''Audi Brand Group'' focused on more sporty values - consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini - and the ''Volkswagen Brand Group'' on the field of classic values - consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti - with each Brand Group's product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.
Under the so-called "Volkswagen Law", no shareholder in Volkswagen AG could exercise more than 20&nbsp;percent of the firm's voting rights, regardless of their level of stock holding.  In October 2005, Porsche acquired an 18.53&nbsp;percent stake in the business, and in July 2006, Porsche increased that ownership to more than 25&nbsp;percent.  Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche's strategy.
 Porsche took its holding to 30.9&nbsp;percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law.  Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche's most important partner.  On 3 March 2008, Porsche announced that it has decided to increase its Volkswagen AG stake up to 51&nbsp;percent, which would be completed before the end of the year.  This was announced just hours after VWAG declared it would take a majority stake in the Swedish truck and engine maker Scania.
On 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35&nbsp;percent.  As of October 2008, Porsche held 42.6&nbsp;percent of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares, and holds stock options on another 31.5&nbsp;percent.  On 28 October 2008, Porsche announced that they effectively held over 74&nbsp;percent; 42.6&nbsp;percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options.  It was announced on 7 January 2009 that Porsche now owns 50.76&nbsp;percent of Volkswagen AG.  Volkswagen AG briefly became the world's most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over    1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions.

The Volkswagen Group comprises nine active automotive companies, and their corresponding marques:
Note:  From July 1998 until December 2002, the Group's Bentley division also sold cars under the Rolls-Royce marque, under an agreement with BMW, which had bought the rights to the Rolls-Royce name, but not the Rolls-Royce operations.  From 2003, only BMW has been able to make cars under the Rolls-Royce marque.
The Group also owns five '''inactive''' marques, via Audi AG:
These heritage marques are retained and managed through the companies '''Auto Union GmbH''' and '''NSU GmbH''', both of which are 100% owned by Audi AG.
Volkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection."", Bloomberg, 24 October 2009.  In November 2009, the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and plan to restart vehicle production at their Osnabruck plant in 2012.
In December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an 'integrated automotive group' with Porsche.  This was agreed between Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE during negotiations on the contracts of implementation relating to the merger of the two companies.  The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE is scheduled to take place during the course of 2011, under VW appointed CEO Matthias Muller.
Volkswagen AG completed the purchase 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation's issued shares on 15 January 2010. Suzuki intends to invest up to one half of the amount received from Volkswagen into shares of Volkswagen.
On 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through it subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.
In only less than three months time, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group.
Volkswagen AG is the controlling shareholder in the Swedish commercial vehicle and diesel engine maker Scania AB, with a capital stake of 37.73%, and 68.60% of the voting rights.  Volkswagen AG originally acquired a stake in Scania after Volvo's aborted takeover attempt in 2000, and then increased that to a capital stake of 16.5% and a voting stake of 33.4% in 2007.  On 3 March 2008, Volkswagen announced that it would acquire all the shares in Scania AB held by Investor AB and the Wallenberg Foundation.  Once cleared by the relevant authorities, Scania became the ninth marque in the Volkswagen Group.
On 4 October 2006, Volkswagen acquired a 15.1% stake in German commercial vehicle maker MAN AG, and later increased to 29.9%.  In 2007, MAN AG launched a hostile offer to acquire Scania AB, but this was subsequently withdrawn.
Former Volkswagen Group CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder, and his successor Martin Winterkorn, have considered a three-way merger between MAN, Scania, Volkswagen AG's own Brazilian heavy truck division, and possibly their light truck and van division as well.  Due to the size of Volkswagen AG's stakes in MAN and Scania, it is expected that Volkswagen AG would own a majority stake in such a merged entity.
The Wallenberg family began divesting its interests in various Swedish companies, but as a result of Volvo's aborted takeover of Scania AB (publ), it agreed to hold a "significant share holding" in only one of Sweden's heavy truck manufacturers.  This resulted in Volkswagen AG securing an 18% capital stake and 34% voting stake in Scania AB.  On the 3 March 2008, it was announced that the Wallenberg's would sell their remaining stake in Scania AB to Volkswagen AG.  The purchase of the stake increased Volkswagen AG's total votes in Scania to 68.60% (previously 37.98%) which corresponds to 37.73% of the capital (previously 20.89%).  , Volkswagen AG holds 70.94% voting rights and 45.66% overall capital of Scania AB.
Volkswagen AG has a 29.9% stake in German truck manufacturer MAN SE (formerly MAN AG).  In 2006, MAN AG launched a takeover bid for the Swedish truck maker Scania, in which Volkswagen AG held, at the time, 20.3% of company and 35.31% of the voting stock.  Volkswagen AG had previously announced that it would like to see MAN and Scania merge, together along with Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Truck and Bus operations, and form a new company in which Volkswagen AG has a blocking minority stake.  However later press released stated that such a merger was not a priority, and Scania would continue to be run as a separate entity.  A merged MAN-Scania would become the largest European truck maker, leapfrogging both Volvo AB and Daimler AG.  However, Daimler will still be the largest worldwide truck maker, as it has operations in the U.S., where MAN and Scania currently do not.
