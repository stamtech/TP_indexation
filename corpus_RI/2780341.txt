His late night infomercial featured Vu surrounded by luxury items: mansions, yachts, expensive cars and most visibly, collections of young bikini clad women. He promoted his free 90-minute seminar to learn the same secrets he used to make millions. As a Vietnamese immigrant, he presented himself as the classic 'rags to riches' story. 
Vu's investment theory involved finding "distressed" properties: foreclosures, bankruptcies, divorces, tax liens, and selling them at a profit. 
Vu's somewhat loose grasp of the English language and his use of beautiful models as backdrops made him one of the more humorous and memorable personalities of the infomercial genre.
Formerly of Longwood, Florida and later a California resident, Vu has retired from real estate and lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Vu continues his parallel career as a tournament poker player. As of 2010, he has won more than $1,500,000 in casino poker tournaments, including a second place finish in a no limit Texas hold 'em event at the 2007 World Series of Poker and a 22nd place finish at the 2005 World Series of Poker championship event. His 4 cashes at the WSOP account for $678,633 of his lifetime tournament winnings.
In April 2006, he finished ninth in the Season Five World Poker Tour championship event, earning $216,585.
