The specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.
Archaeologists contend that Paleo-Indians migration out of Beringia (eastern Alaska), ranges somewhere between 40,000 and 16,500 years ago. The few agreements achieved to date are the origin from Central Asia, with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the last glacial period, or more specifically what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,000   13,000 years before present.
The Inuit migrated into the Arctic section of North America in another wave of migration, arriving around 1000 CE.
The pre-Columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic to European colonization during the Early Modern period.
Pre-Columbian is used especially often in the context of the great indigenous civilizations of the Americas, such as those of Mesoamerica (the Olmec, the Toltec, the Teotihuacano, the Zapotec, the Mixtec, the Aztec, and the Maya) and the Andes (Inca, Moche, Muisca, Canaris).
Many pre-Columbian civilizations established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies.  Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th   early 16th centuries), and are known only through archaeological investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya, had their own written records.  However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as heretical, and much was destroyed in Christian pyres. Only a few hidden documents remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.
According to both indigenous American and European accounts and documents, American civilizations at the time of European encounter possessed many impressive accomplishments.  For instance, the Aztecs built one of the most impressive cities in the world, Tenochtitlan, the ancient site of Mexico City, with an estimated population of 200,000.  American civilizations also displayed impressive accomplishments in astronomy and mathematics.
Large-scale European colonization of the Americas began shortly after the first voyages of Christopher Columbus began in 1492. The first Spanish settlement on the continent was Panama City on the Pacific coast of Central America founded on August 5, 1519. Panama City was the base for the Spanish conquering of South America. The spread of new diseases brought by Europeans and Africans killed many of the inhabitants of North America and South America, with a general population crash of Native Americans occurring in the mid-16th century, often well ahead of European contact. Native peoples and European colonizers came into widespread conflict, resulting in what David Stannard has called a genocide of the indigenous populations.Staff.  of ''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World'' (by David Stannard), on the website of the Oxford University Press (the publishers) Early European immigrants were often part of state-sponsored attempts to found colonies in the Americas. Migration continued as people moved to the Americas fleeing religious persecution or seeking economic opportunities. Millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas as slaves, prisoners or indentured servants.
 states, "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part , after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerigen, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women". ''Americus Vespucius'' is the Latinized version of the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci's name, and ''America'' is the feminine form of ''Americus''. ''Amerigen'' is explained as ''Amerigo'' plus ''gen,'' the accusative case of the Greek word for 'earth', and meaning 'land of Amerigo'. (See  .) ''Amerigo'' itself is an Italian form of the medieval Latin ''Emericus'' (see also Saint Emeric of Hungary), which through the German form Heinrich (in English, Henry) derived from the Germanic name ''Haimirich''.
Vespucci was apparently unaware of the use of his name to refer to the new landmass, as Waldseemuller's maps did not reach Spain until a few years after his death. Ringmann may have been misled into crediting Vespucci by the widely published Soderini Letter, a sensationalized version of one of Vespucci's actual letters reporting on the mapping of the South American coast, which glamorized his discoveries and implied that he had recognized that South America was a continent separate from Asia; in fact, it is not known what Vespucci believed on this count, and he may have died believing what Columbus had, that they had reached the East Indies in Asia rather than a new continent. Spain officially refused to accept the name ''America'' for two centuries, saying that Columbus should get credit, and Waldseemuller's later maps, after he had ceased collaboration with Ringmann, did not include it; however, usage was established when Gerardus Mercator applied the name to the entire New World in his 1538 world map. Acceptance may have been aided by the "natural poetic counterpart" that the name ''America'' made with ''Asia, Africa,'' and ''Europa.''
South America broke off from the west of the supercontinent Gondwanaland around 135 million years ago (Ma), forming its own continent. Starting around 15 Ma, the collision of the Caribbean Plate and the Pacific Plate resulted in the emergence of a series of volcanoes along the border that created a number of islands. The gaps in the archipelago of Central America filled in with material eroded off North America and South America, plus new land created by continued volcanism. By 3 Ma, the continents of North America and South America were linked by the Isthmus of Panama, thereby forming the single landmass of the Americas.
The northernmost point of the Americas is Kaffeklubben Island, which is the northernmost point of land on Earth. The southernmost point is the islands of Southern Thule, although they are sometimes considered part of Antarctica. The easternmost point is Nordostrundingen. The westernmost point is Attu Island.
The mainland of the Americas is the longest north-to-south landmass on Earth. At its longest, it stretches roughly 14,000&nbsp;kilometres, (just under 8700&nbsp;miles) from the Boothia Peninsula in northern Canada to Cape Froward in Chilean Patagonia. The westernmost point of the mainland of the Americas is the end of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska, while Ponta do Seixas in northeastern Brazil forms the mainland's easternmost extremity.
The western geography of the Americas is dominated by the American cordillera, with the Andes running along the west coast of South America and the Rocky Mountains and other North American Cordillera ranges running along the western side of North America. The 2300&nbsp;km long  (1429&nbsp;mile long) Appalachian Mountains run along the east coast of North America from Alabama to Newfoundland. North of the Appalachians, the Arctic Cordillera runs along the eastern coast of Canada.
The ranges with the highest peaks are the Andes and Rock Mountain range. While high peaks exists in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range, on average there are not as many reaching a height greater than fourteen thousand feet. In North America, the largest amount of fourteeners occur in the United States and more specifically in the U.S. state of Colorado. The highest peaks in the Americas are located in the Andes with Aconcagua of Argentina being the highest; in North America Denali of the United States is the tallest.
Between its coastal mountain ranges, North America has vast flat areas. The Interior Plains spread over much of the continent with low relief. The Canadian Shield covers almost 5 million km   of North America and is generally quite flat. Similarly, the north-east of South America is covered by the flat Amazon Basin. The Brazilian Highlands on the east coast are fairly smooth but show some variations in landform, while further south the Gran Chaco and Pampas are broad lowlands.
With coastal mountains and interior plains, the Americas have several large river basins that drain the continents.  The largest river basin in North America is that of the Mississippi, covering the second largest watershed on the planet. The Mississippi-Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the U.S., most of the Great Plains, and large areas between the Rock and Appalachian mountains. This river is the fourth longest in the world and tenth most powerful in the world.
In North America, to the east of the Appalachian Mountains, there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean; these rivers included the Savannah River. A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into Hudson Bay; the largest being the Churchill River. On the west coast of North America, the main rivers are the Colorado River, Columbia River, Yukon River, and Sacramento River.
The largest river basin in South America is that of the Amazon, which has the highest volume flow of any river on Earth. The second largest watershed of South America is that of the Parana River, which covers about 2.5 million km  .
The climate of the Americas varies significantly from region to region. The hottest places in the Americas are located in the Great Basin of North America and the Atacama Desert in Chile. Tropical rainforest climate occurs in the latitudes of the Amazon, American Cloud forests, Florida and Darien Gap. In the Rocky Mountains and Andes, a similar climate is observed. Often the higher altitudes of these mountains are snow capped.
Southeastern North America is well known for it's occurrence of tornadoes and hurricanes, of which the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the United States' Tornado Alley. Often parts of the Caribbean are exposed to the violent effects of hurricanes. These weather systems are formed by the collision of dry, cool air from Canada and wet, warm air from the Atlantic.
The total population of the Americas is about 859,000,000 people and is divided as follows:
There are three urban centers that each hold titles for being the largest population area based on the three main demographic concepts:
In accordance with these definitions, the three largest population centers in the Americas are: Mexico City, anchor to the largest metropolitan area in the Americas; New York City, anchor to the largest urban area in the Americas; and Sao Paulo, the largest city proper in the Americas. All three cities maintain Alpha classification and large scale influence.
The Americas are home to an array of global cities with key importance in finance, politics, and the global economy. Cities such as Los Angeles - the ''Entertainment Capital of the World'' - lead the world in entertainment, while others such as New York City, Toronto, San Francisco, and Chicago serve as global financial centers and cities such as Houston are centers for aeronautics and health. Of the global cities in the Americas, the most powerful and highest ranked are located in Northern America. GaWC ranked the top global cities in the Americas as:
In 2010 the index was updated, and the top American cities of the global 30 ranked were: 
The Institute for Urban Strategies at The Mori Memorial Foundation in Tokyo, Japan issued a comprehensive study of global cities in 2009. The ranking is based on six overall categories, "Economy", "Research & Development", "Cultural Interaction", "Livability", "Ecology & Natural Environment", and "Accessibility", with 69 individual indicators among them.
In 2010 the London based consultant firm Knight Frank LLP together with the Citibank published a survey of world cities. The Wealth Report 2010, which includes the World City Survey, assesses four parameters     economic activity, political power, knowledge and influence and quality of life. The list aimed to rank the world's most influential cities. New York tops the list in Ecomomic activity, political power and knowledge and Paris tops it in quality of life. London and Paris get the same aggregate ranking of 149, making them ''de facto'' world's 2nd and 3rd most prominent cities.
The population of the Americas is made up of the descendants of five large ethnic groups and their combinations.
The majority of the population live in Latin America, named for its predominant cultures whose roots lie in Latin Europe (including the two dominant languages, Spanish and Portuguese, both neolatin), more specifically in the Iberian nations of Portugal and Spain (hence the use of the term Ibero-America as a synonym). Latin America is typically contrasted with Anglo-America (where English, a Germanic language, is prevalent) which comprises  Canada (with the exception of francophone Canada rooted in Latin Europe (France): see Quebec and Acadia) and the United States. Both are located in North America and present predominantly Anglo-Saxon and Germanic roots.
The most prevalent faiths in the Americas are as follows:
Other faiths include Sikhism; Buddhism; Hinduism; Baha'i; a wide variety of indigenous religions, many of which can be categorized as animistic; new age religions and many African and African-derived religions. Syncretic faiths can also be found throughout the continent.
Various languages are spoken in the Americas. Some are of European origin, others are spoken by indigenous peoples or are the mixture of various idioms like the different creoles.
The dominant language of Latin America is Spanish, though the largest nation in Latin America, Brazil, speaks Portuguese. Small enclaves of French-, Dutch- and English-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in French Guiana, Suriname and Belize respectively, and Haitian Creole, of French origin, is dominant in the nation of Haiti. Native languages are more prominent in Latin America than in Anglo-America, with Nahuatl, Quechua, Aymara and Guarani as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. Creole languages other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.
The dominant language of Anglo-America, as the name suggests, is English. French is also official in Canada, where it is the predominant language in Quebec and an official language in New Brunswick along with English. It is also an important language in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and in parts of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the Southwestern United States, which formed part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, especially in California and New Mexico, where a distinct variety of Spanish spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the United States due to heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.
The nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America due to lingual differences with Latin America, geographic differences with Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences with both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the official and written language of Suriname.
Most of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as Papiamento, which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native Arawak, various African languages, and, more recently English. Portunol, a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries. More specifically, Riverense Portunol is spoken by around 100,000 people in the border regions of Brazil and Uruguay. Due to immigration, there are many communities where other languages are spoken from all parts of the world&mdash;especially in the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Canada, four very important destinations for immigrants&mdash; and half of the population of Uruguay is thought to be of Italian descent.
Use of the word ''America'' to refer to the relevant lands and regions of the Western hemisphere remains fairly common; for example, for unofficial purposes the International Olympic Committee considers "America" one of the five populated continents, as represented by the five rings on the Olympic flag.
People in the United States of America generally refer to the landmasses of North America and South America as (the) ''Americas'' (plural and generally with the definite article), to US citizens as Americans and the United States as ''America''. Since the 19th century, this sense is primary in English, not without uncertainties. However, use of the term in this context may cause offense to people from Canada and Latin America and, thus, they avoid this usage and prefer constructed terms derived from United States or North America."America." ''Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage.'' (ISBN 0-19-541619-8) Fee, Margery and McAlpine, J., ed., 1997. Toronto: Oxford University Press; p. 36.}} In Canada, its southern neighbor is often referred to as "the United States", "the U.S.A.", or (informally) "the States," while citizens are generally referred to as Americans.

People unconnected with the United States rarely call themselves ''American''. The English-speaking world normally uses the word to refer to a permanent resident of the United States of America, or a person born in the U.S. and identified with it.  Canadians abroad typically resent being referred to as "Americans".
In Spanish, ''America'' is the name of a single continent composed of the subcontinents of ''Sudamerica'' and ''Norteamerica'', the land bridge of ''Centroamerica'', and the islands of the ''Antillas''. ''Americano/a'' in Spanish refers to a person from ''America'' in a similar way that ''europeo'' or ''europea'' refers to a person from ''Europa''. The terms ''sudamericano/a'', ''centroamericano/a'', ''antillano/a'' and ''norteamericano/a'' can be used to more specifically refer to the location where a person may live.
Citizens of the United States of America are normally referred to by the term ''estadounidense'' (rough literal translation: "United Statesian") instead of ''americano'' or ''americana'', and the country's name itself is often translated as ''Estados Unidos de America'' (United States of America). Also, the term ''norteamericano'' (North American) may refer to a citizen of the United States. This term is primarily used to refer to citizens of the United States, rarely those of other North American countries.
In Portuguese, the word ''americano'' refers to the whole of the ''Americas''. But, in Brazil and Portugal, it is widely used to refer to the citizens of the United States. The least ambiguous terms, ''estadunidense'' (used in Brazil, something like "United Statesian" or "estadounidense" in Spanish), and "ianque"   the Portuguese version of "Yankee"   are rarely used.
In French, as in English, the word ''americain'' can be confusing as it can be used to refer either to the United States, or to the American continents.
The noun ''Amerique'' sometimes refers to the whole as one continent, and sometimes two continents, southern and northern; the United States is generally referred to as ''les Etats-Unis d'Amerique'', ''les Etats-Unis'', or ''les USA''.   In Quebec, the United States are sometimes called ''les Etats'' or even simply ''les states'' in daily informal conversation.  However, the use of ''Amerique'' to refer to the United States does still have some currency in France.
The adjective ''americain'' is most often used for things relating to the United States; however, it may also be used for things relating to the American continents. Books by United States authors translated from English are often described as "traduit de l'americain".
Things relating to the United States can be referred to without ambiguity by the words ''etats-unien'', ''etasunien'', or ''etatsunien'', although this usage is rare.
In Dutch, the word ''Amerika'' mostly refers to the United States. Although the United States is equally often referred to as ''de Verenigde Staten'' or ''de VS'', ''Amerika'' relatively rarely refers to the Americas, but it is the only commonly used Dutch word for the Americas. This often leads to ambiguity and to stress that something concerns the Americas as a whole, Dutch uses a combination, namely ''Noord- en Zuid-Amerika'' (North and South America).
Latin America is generally referred to as ''Latijns Amerika'' or, less frequently, ''Zuid-Amerika'' (South America).
The adjective ''amerikaans'' is most often used for things or people relating to the United States. There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas. Dutch uses the local alternative for things relating to elsewhere in the Americas, such as ''Argentijns'' for Argentine, etc.
In the 19th century in Russia the word "America" was used for a traditional continent such as Europe and Asia. In the 20th century these traditional continents are known as "parts of the world". Now the term "continent" means any of six large continuous landmasses (Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, and Australia). Now the word ''Ameri  a'' refers to the United States more often than to America as a "part of the world". There is no term equivalent to "Americas" in Russian.
There are 35 sovereign states in the Americas, 23 in North America and 12 in South America:
The following is a list of overseas regions, dependencies and other polities in the Americas that do not fall into the category "sovereign states". They are grouped under the states that control them.
