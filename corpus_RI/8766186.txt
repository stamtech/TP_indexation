The result was    '''delete'''.   00:02, 21 October 2009 (UTC)
Three reasons for deletion. First, I'm sure all US Presidents since Truman (not to mention dozens of other heads of state and heads of government) have spoken to the UN General Assembly. That it's Obama's first, and that he espoused platitudes about "re-engaging the UN", does not lift it above the others in terms of notability. Nor does the media coverage it garnered make it notable: the US media covers every move of every US President, . Second, speeches to the General Assembly are ''known'' for being momentary affairs: as one historian , "I don   t think anybody has ever done a real study of General Assembly speeches because nobody listens to them". And third, to the extent that what Obama said may be notable in a wider context, we already have Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration, Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration, Presidency of Barack Obama, Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama, and so on; we can work mention of the speech into relevant places there. No need for this to stay.     01:38, 14 October 2009 (UTC)
