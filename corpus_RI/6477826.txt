Mitchell was born to an American father, Dennis Mitchell, and an Australian mother of Asian descent (specifically Filipino, Malaysian, Singaporean, Indian, and others), Eleanor Majid.
Mitchell played her first three years of college basketball at the University of Idaho. Mitchell then transferred to the University of Utah. She sat out the 2006-07 season under NCAA rules, and then played the 2007-08 season for Utah.
Mitchell was drafted by the San Antonio Silver Stars twenty-fifth overall in the second round of 2008 WNBA Draft. Mitchell was then traded to the Phoenix Mercury. When the New York Liberty learned during the 2008 pre-season that the Mercury planned to cut Mitchell, the Liberty acquired Mitchell in a trade in exchange for a 2009 third round draft pick.
Initially a bench player, Mitchell made her first professional start on June 6, 2008 in place of the injured Loree Moore.  During the 2008 season she developed a strong fan following and a reputation for fearlessness in grabbing loose balls and occasionally driving to the basket.
Mitchell scored 14 points in the Liberty's narrow loss to the Detroit Shock in Game 3 of the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals.
Mitchell scored her career high 20 points in a win aganist Tulsa Shock.
Mitchell became the regular starting point guard in the 2010 season, after the Liberty released Moore in the offseason. Mitchell led the WNBA in 3-point percentage at 48%, scored 9.3 points per game, and had 3.8 assists per game en route to winning the 2010 WNBA Most Improved Player Award.
Mitchell has played for ASPTT Arras in the Ligue Feminine de Basketball (LFB), a French professional league, during the WNBA off-season. For the 2009-10 season, Mitchell won the Import Player of the Year Award and was named to the LFB 1st Team.
