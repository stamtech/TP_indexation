In October 2007, it announced plans for its largest marketing campaign ever in early 2008. In the same month, Yahoo! announced plans to receive listings from Cars.com for their Yahoo! Autos service. The deal would allow cars.com listings to appear as advertisements targeted at consumers based on information they are looking at on Yahoo services.
For Super Bowl 2011, Cars.com has created 2 all new commercials centered around consumer and expert car reviews. The Talking Cars commercial revolves around a group of cars who can't get enough about hearing all the interesting features consumers say they have to offer. The You Go First commercial insinuates that sometimes it is better to learn from other people's experience to discover what is best for you.  For the Super Bowl 2010, Cars.com made a mascot by the name of Timothy Richman, and showed how he and everyone else can be confident in many other things in life except when buying a car, therefore needing to use Cars.com to help make their purchases. Previously, in 2009, they had a commercial with David Abernathy, another mascot, that was also in the super bowl.
Since July 1998, Cars.com has been in partnership with Tom and Ray Magliozzi of Cartalk.
Cars.com is the exclusive online provider of used-car reports from Carfax.
Cars.com also partners with MotorWeek on PBS to provide online access to MotorWeek reviews.
