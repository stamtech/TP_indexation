The '''Volvo RM8''' is a low-bypass afterburning turbofan jet engine developed for the Saab 37 Viggen fighter. An extensively modified Pratt & Whitney JT8D with a Swedish-designed afterburner, the RM8 was originally produced by Svenska Flygmotor, and from 1970 by Volvo Flygmotor (now Volvo Aero). In December 1961, the basic JT8D-22 engine was chosen to be militarized by Svenska Flygmotor in order to power the Viggen in absence of a suitable and available engine designed for military use.
