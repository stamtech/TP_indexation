A dominant estate is also called a '''dominant tenement''', as noted in 
a section of an article on easements.
In real estate law, it is the property retained when the original owner (the seller or grantor) splits off a property and conveys part of the original property; the owner retains an easement for an access (such as a driveway or utilities). 
In certain cases, ''dominant estate'' refers specifically to a parcel or building premises that is subject to a cell tower or a solar panel: "that parcel of land to which the benefits of a solar access easement attach." 
Most states in the United States recognize this common law notion of estate.  
It is not clear whether all community property states have the same concept, but it is recognized in Arizona and Texas. 
It is recognized in Canadian law, where it is known, in French as '''Fond dominant'''.
