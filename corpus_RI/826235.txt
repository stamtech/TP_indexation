According to the article, Lucian Yahoo was born December 2004 in Medias, Romania.  His parents, Nonu and Cornelia Dragoman, supposedly met online, and had a virtual relationship for three months before meeting in person.  The story quoted the mother as saying: ''"We named him Lucian Yahoo, one name after my father and the other from the computer. These were the two elements which guided my life."''While people have legally changed their names to that of a business, this story was presumed to be the first person named at birth after a highly identifiable product or service.
