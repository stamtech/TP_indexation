NY&nbsp;393 was assigned in the early 1930s as a signed designation for a highway that the state of New York had assumed maintenance of in the 1910s. It originally extended west along Mitchell Street to NY&nbsp;79, but was truncated to Ithaca Road when NY&nbsp;13 was rerouted through Ithaca in the mid-1930s. The NY&nbsp;393 designation was removed in the mid-1960s, and its former routing is now maintained by the city of Ithaca and Tompkins County. The designation is currently reserved by the New York State Department of Transportation for a highway in Chautauqua County.
NY&nbsp;393 began at the intersection of Mitchell Street and Ithaca Road in the city of Ithaca. Here, NY&nbsp;13 turned off Mitchell Street to follow Ithaca Road while NY&nbsp;393 continued eastward on Mitchell Street. It passed through the community of East Ithaca and entered the surrounding town of Ithaca. In the town of Ithaca, NY&nbsp;393 intersected Pine Tree Road (County Route&nbsp;174 or CR&nbsp;174) and passed through areas with varying levels of development before ending at Game Farm Road, here marking the boundary between the towns of Ithaca and Dryden. The roadway continued eastward into Dryden as a locally maintained highway.
The portion of Mitchell Street and Ellis Hollow Road from the city of Ithaca to the Ithaca   Dryden town line had existed as early as 1900. In the early 1910s, the state of New York helped finance improvements to the portion of the highway within the town of Ithaca. The highway was added to the state highway system in late October 1914. In 1916, construction began on an upgrade of Mitchell Street in Ithaca, again partially paid for by the state of New York. All of Mitchell Street was accepted into the state highway system on August&nbsp;31, 1917.
 NY&nbsp;13 was realigned through Ithaca ca. 1936 to bypass the campus of Cornell University to the south along Dryden Road, Ithaca Road, and Mitchell Street. As a result, NY&nbsp;393 was truncated slightly to begin at the junction of Ithaca Road and Mitchell Street. NY&nbsp;393 remained unchanged until the mid-1960s when it was removed from the state highway system. The portion of NY&nbsp;393's former routing in the city of Ithaca is now city-maintained while the remainder of the highway in the town of Ithaca is now part of CR&nbsp;110.
The NY&nbsp;393 designation is currently reserved by the New York State Department of Transportation for a proposed "Chautauqua Lakeway" in Chautauqua County between NY&nbsp;17 and NY&nbsp;5. No timetable exists for the Lakeway's construction nor for NY&nbsp;393's reassignment.
