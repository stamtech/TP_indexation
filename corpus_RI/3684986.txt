Double or nothing in a betting situation is where the loser loses a previous bet, wants another chance, and says double or nothing. If the winner accepts then they play. if the challenger wins then he gets half of the deal and he pays off his debt and the other person gets nothing. but if he loses then the winner of the initial bet gets double the amount originally bet.
In general, a double-or-nothing bet does not double the original bet, it doubles the winnings (it does not double both). For example, if you owe someone $20 and you place a bet with them and win, you then have $40. A double-or-nothing bet off of this original bet would not duplicate the first bet since the money used to make that bet was owed. The loser would have to bring $40 of their own to the second bet in order to match the pot. 
In poker, a double or nothing tournament is an online sit'n'go tournament where the surviving half of players gets double the buy-in and the eliminated half does not receive any prizes. Double or nothing tournaments are mostly played by ten players (five players win) or six players (three win), although multi-table versions, such as for 20 players, exist. The rake in these tournaments is usually smaller than in standard sit'n'go tournaments. Some poker rooms also offer triple or nothing tournaments, where one third of the playing field gets paid.
In a regular poker sit   n   go it is correct to play with the intention of accumulating 100% of the chips in the game, thereby placing 1st and securing for yourself the maximum possible prize money. In a double or nothing poker sit   n   go it is now no longer relevant if you finish the game with 100% of the chips or only 1% of the chips, as long as you are still in the game once 50% of the players have been eliminated. Because of this difference in prize structure, a double or nothing poker sit   n   go requires significantly different poker strategy than a regular poker sit'n'go.
