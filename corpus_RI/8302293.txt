Fleetsatcom 3 was launched on 18 January 1980 at 01:26 UTC on an Atlas-Centaur rocket. The launch took place at Cape Canaveral, Florida. FSC-3 was at an inclination of 26.2 degrees. It had a periapsis of 171&nbsp;km and an apoapsis of 3524&nbsp;km and an orbital period of 619 minutes.
The satellite was 1.7 meters high by 2.7 meters in diameter and a hexagonal shape. Fleetsatcom 3 had a 5.3 meter wire mesh parabolic communications antenna with 2 meter solid center sections extended from one end of the vehicle. Fleetsatcom 3 was a triaxial stabilized satellite. It utilized a reaction control wheel assembly instead of spin stabilization. The satellite produced 1.1&nbsp;kW DC, using 2 three-section solar panels mounted on booms extending from the satellite. The craft used Nickle-Cadmium batteries for power during solar eclipses. The FSC satellites where the heaviest communications satellite used by the United States, exceeding TACSAT-1 by over 250&nbsp;lbs.
