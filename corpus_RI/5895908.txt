Duplicate poker is a skill-based game in which there are two or more tables consisting of the same number of players.  Each table is dealt with an identically shuffled deck of cards.  Every player holds the same hand as the person seated in identical seats at other tables. 
All players begin each hand with the ability to bet the same number of playing chips, regardless of prior performance in the previous rounds. 
The object of Duplicate poker is to win more chips than your opponents sitting in corresponding seats at other tables. Ultimately, the winner is decided based on the total number of chips accumulated up until the end of the game, as compared with those held by all players in the same seats at the other tables.  Conceivably, even a player who loses chips overall can win at the game if that player loses fewer chips than his opponents.
Duplicatepoker.com, the first poker room to use the format, closed down on October 5th 2008, citing the global financial crisis as the reason for the removal of services. It had previously been popular due to the fact that as a skill-based game it was legal in the U.S.
While the game is more conducive to an automated online format because of pre-set decks and the need to record accurate scoring, Duplicate poker has also been played in a live format.  The first-ever Duplicate poker tournament was held in April 2007 at the Cherokee Casino in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The principal difference from playing standard poker is Duplicate poker's measure of results, which are between players sitting at corresponding seats at other tables.  Player performance is measured relatively to other players sitting in their parallel seat.
