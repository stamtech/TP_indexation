It was founded in 1928 as '''Litchfield Park High School'''. In 1956, the school was moved to Avondale and gained its present name.
Agua Fria offers college preparatory coursework, along with career and technical education. Agua Fria also offers a respected music program; the Night Owl Jazz band regularly performs at jazz festivals throughout the Phoenix Area, and has qualified for the Arizona State Jazz Festival in both 2006 and 2007. Also in 2006, the Agua Fria Band of Owls was the first to receive a rating of "superior with distinctions" in the district.
Agua Fria basketball has been prominent in tournaments and championships. From 2007 to 2009, the varsity team made it to the 4A-I state finals, but fell short of winning the championship to Millennium High School (division rivals) and Sunnyslope High School.
In the late spring of 2011, covered parking with solar panel installations will be added to Agua Fria and Millennium high schools; the district had already added solar panels to the roofs at Desert Edge High School and Verrado High School in 2010. It is estimated that some 40 percent of the entire district's energy needs will come from solar panels at its high schools upon completion.
