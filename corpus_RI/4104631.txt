Prior to founding Envision Solar, Bob Noble was the CEO of Tucker Sadler Architects, an eco-friendly architectural firm; Tucker Sadler Architects, Midwest General Construction, and Kyocera Solar have partnered with Envision Solar to develop and construct Solar Groves and LifePorts. Envision Solar was formed in 2006 after a collaboration with Tucker Sadler Architects and Kyocera to develop a solar carport at Kyocera International and since then the company has been receiving interest nationally and internationally.
Solar Trees consist of a central pole that supports a "canopy" of solar panels, which are designed to be built above cars in parking lots to create shade and generate solar power without encumbering the parking spaces. Each Solar Tree provides shade for eight to ten vehicles. The company has incorporated bioswales into Solar Groves to reduce storm water runoff pollution. The company is also currently developing LifePorts, which are non-commercial carports, designed to be used as a four or two car garage or storage area, which Noble claims is "easier than putting solar panels on your roof."
In May 2006, The first Solar Grove, consisting of 25-trees, was installed at the Kyocera International, Inc. parking lot in San Diego, California. The Solar Grove provided more than 100 percent of electricity of the San Diego Kyocera office and saved Kyocera $50,000 in electricity costs in the first year by generating 428,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, which is enough electricity to power 68 average San Diego single-family homes. The Solar Groves at Kyocera International cost approxmitly $3 million before the application of slightly more than $1 million in subsidies and incentives.
