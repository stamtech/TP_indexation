  Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979.  Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament "more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire."  Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event. 
One of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure.  The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool.  The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure.  In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third.  This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.
The 1989 SBOP was the third time wherein Poker Hall of Famer Stu Ungar won the main event.  Ungar was the only person to win back-to-back tournaments and the only person to win the SBOP three times.  Ungar was also the only person to win the WSOP Main Event three times.  While Johnny Moss is a three time WSOP Main Event winner, his first victory came as a result of a vote rather than the elimination tournament that it would assume the following year.  Berry Johnston, another Hall of Famer, also won an event by claiming the title in the $200 Pot Limit Omaha with Rebuys tournament.  Relatively little is preserved about the 1989 tournament.  In most cases, the only thing that has been preserved was the name of the event winners, and in a few cases not even that much was recorded.
