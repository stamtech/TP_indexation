Map of the range of the Nine-banded Armadillo in the United States, created by  .  This map is based in part on the following maps:
The areas colored red indicate present range of the Nine-banded Armadillo in the United States, as of approximately 2006, and the areas colored pink are areas in which the species should eventually be able to establish itself based on climate and soil conditions, according to the first source cited above.  That source also indicated large areas of the west coast of the United States as being suitable for armadillo expansion, but that would depend on human intervention as the armadillo is not likely to be able to establish itself in points eastward (i.e. the Rocky Mountains) which lie between its current range and the Pacific coast.
