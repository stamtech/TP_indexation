Disputed prod (a few times) - procedural listing.   ( ) 17:12, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
This word was invented by a troll in Yahoo Answers who goes under over a dozen names. He asks questions constantly that try to put "normal" people in a bad light.  He also created the entry in the urban dictionary.  He has referred to both asking for people's opinions of them. Both are written in the same writing-style as his Yahoo Answers questions.  (For confirmation of this do a search on Yahoo Answers on the word "unnice" and you will find that   PeteandCl, Pastasauce88, Cheesecakefries, Bostongreenleaf, Sucker, Chilidogsteak, lemonaidjuiceii, jigganyc, royalsweethights, noreagared, cherrysodalime, No pity, Magixstick, N, and others all write very similar questions citing "normal" people as "unnice".) 
I think the person who created the word has a mental health issue.  No self-respecting person with a disability would use it. No self-respecting person with a disability would refer to people without disabilities as "normal". This "unword" needs to be removed in its entirety.  I have edited the entry at least 5 times only to have my edits removed. Xuxan   ( ) 00:50, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
