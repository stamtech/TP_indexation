Skelleftea is believed to have been inhabited from around 1000 AD by the Sami people and possibly in part by Finnish people.
The name Skelleftea was recorded as being spelled Skelepht in 1327, but its origin remains unknown.
Archeologists have found that people were living in the area as far back as 8000 years ago.
In the 14th century attempts were made to Christianize Skelleftea. Norrland was not Christianized until several hundred years after the rest of Sweden, and northern cities such as Skelleftea were largely unexplored. The reason for the sudden awakened interest was the fishing of salmon in the areas around Skelleftea, which was sparked by an increased demand of fish, due to stricter enforcement of the annual month long fasting by the Catholic Church whereby meat was substituted by fish.
The city itself is much younger, and in fact one of the youngest cities of Norrland. It was founded in 1845 by vicar Nils Nordlander.
In the 20th century Skelleftea evolved to an industrial and mining city and  many wooden houses were demolished to give room for brick buildings.
The largest private employer in Skelleftea is the mining company Boliden AB, with about 1,200 employees. Mining is done for gold, and Skelleftea is sometimes referred to as the Goldtown. During the 90's, the computer industry flurished, causing subsidiaries of Ericsson and Tieto Enator to become important employers.
If things go according to plan, Skelleftea will be the site of the hind legs of the world's largest moose     Stoorn     a tourist attraction planned to be built spanning from Skelleftea into Arvidsjaur in Norrbotten.
Skelleftea is served by the Vasterbotten County Police Department, Skelleftea Division (Polismyndigheten i Vasterbottens lan, Skelleftea).
Mainly, the Skelleftea Police uses Volvo XC70 and Volvo V70 but also has a few Mercedes and Volkswagen vans.
