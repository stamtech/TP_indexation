The graphics folks of the de-WP created the subdivision map for Darwin, Northern Territory. However, there are no articles in the de-WP for individual suburbs of Darwin in the de-WP yet, so a request for the creation of individual locator maps on this basis won't be honored there.
So if I see this correctly, the map currently has two colour categories (member states that are EU members, and member states that aren't) plus a shade for observers (only Libya, which is not a member of the EU, and therefore green). There is a different categorization; the Arab League. Many of the non-EU members in the Mediterranean Union are members of the Arab League. Yet although the article at Union_for_the_Mediterranean#Members gives Arab League flags for some countries in the same position as the EU flags, the Arab League does not seem to be involved in the Mediterranean Union, at least not in the way the EU (financially) is. Is that correct? Moreover, it only makes sense to use different (non-shaded) colours if memberships are exclusive; couldn't a country be in theory both a member of the EU and of the Arab League? In short, I think changing the legend to reflect the division EU/non-EU members more clearly makes more sense than adjusting the map - even though doing so would be quite easy.

See third map for possible starting point. --  ( ) 01:54, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
Hmm what do you mean by combined?  You want it to be a terrain map with political boundaries on it?  Do you know of a map you want it to look like?    ( ) 15:36, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
Hi!! I was wondering if you could produce a set of decent svg blank maps of Indian states in the style of   but for the states. You see, the maps of Indian states are generally of a poor standard and are too colorful for push pin and we definitely need standardised replacements. Also is there any chance you could create a svg map of Russia like  ?  15:37, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
I've reformatted the request into proper format and added a few current examples.  I assume you want the districts uncolored (but outlined?) and the rivers but not other features.  You have looked at the  .--  ( ) 18:53, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
Yes they are too plain. The maps need to display the districts anyway...  14:11, 31 August 2009 (UTC)
Hello, I'm hoping to make a map of the route of the Keystone Pipeline currently under construction.  The pipeline runs through several Canadian provinces and US states, so I need a blank map that contains both of these.  Unfortunately the only one I can find is  , which is huge and gives me strange rendering problems in inkscape.  Does anyone know if there is a blank map somewhere that shows US and Canadian states/provinces but isn't so detailed?  Thanks a lot.    ( ) 21:21, 8 September 2009 (UTC)
Here is the best color coded map of Beirut i could find on the web 
Although a map with administrative partitions would be nice, these are not necessary Thank you for your feedback and help   08:11, 21 September 2009 (UTC)
Hopefully this is what you're looking for! Note that the changes sometimes don't appear right away so you might need to refresh the page to see them...
Image:Hawaii Island topographic map-fr.svg|This SVG may help.
Anyone, please??????  ( ) 18:35, 25 August 2009 (UTC)
Map needs to show:
Outline of three regions of the Electorate (Oberstift, Niederstift, County of Vest) (Vest=portions of Westphalia)
Names of adjoining/adjacent territories
Rivers and prominent geological features
Names of the following towns (where there were battles)
Well I'm by no means an expert, but I'll try and trace out the salient parts of this map as an SVG.    ( ) 22:24, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
I have uploaded  .  By simple interpolation, I reckon the co-ordinates for your  are: top=-23.182321, bottom=-26.942253, left=109.990368, right=114.428595. The change of scale has made it look rather jagged, but it has more detail than any free SVG of the area I can find.  Feel free to remove the inset (or ask me to) if it is unhelpful or gets in the way of the dots' legends.   ( ) 11:22, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
Alternatively, we could start with one of the maps in the Shark Bay article, but I don't think the colours and projections they use are standard for location maps, and they may not extend quite far enough north.   ( ) 11:29, 13 November 2009 (UTC)
The map you have uploaded does nicely. Thank you --  
How about this?   ( ) 23:13, 12 November 2009 (UTC)
I found a better source map here  I can fix a new svg map from that source this weekend.   ( ) 22:51, 12 November 2009 (UTC)
