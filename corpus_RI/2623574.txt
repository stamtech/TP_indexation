Jack became president of the Horseshoe in 1963 at the age of 26.
Jack's fame grew following his 1970 hosting of the first World Series of Poker at the Horseshoe which became the largest set of poker tournaments in the world. Privately held, Binion's Horseshoe became renowned as one of Nevada's most successful casino operations.
In 1998, following a protracted legal battle for control of the Horseshoe among Benny Binion's heirs, Jack sold his interest in Binion's Horseshoe to his sister, Becky Behnen, while retaining a token 1% interest in the operation so that he could lawfully retain his Nevada Gaming License.  He also acquired the rights to the Horseshoe brand outside of Nevada.  
Jack went on to form Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corporation which developed and operated several riverboat casinos under the Horseshoe name. Jack continued to promote the casinos for Harrah's Entertainment following his sale of the company in 2004 to Harrah's. As of 2008, Binion's name appears on the "Jack Binion's Steakhouse" at Horseshoe Tunica and Horseshoe Hammond and several of the Horseshoe-branded casinos still carry slot machines bearing Binion's likeness called "Who Wants To Be A Binionaire?" that originated before the Harrah's acquisition.
While running Horseshoe Gaming, Jack started the World Poker Open which has become one of the major feeder tournaments for the World Series of Poker.
Jack was inducted into the American Gaming Association's Gaming Hall of Fame on June 11, 2004.  The following year on July 6, 2005 the World Series of Poker, inducted him into the Poker Hall of Fame.
In July 2006, Jack became chairman of Wynn International.  His responsibilities included opening the Wynn Macau. He has since resigned the position but has remained with Wynn Resorts in a consulting role.
