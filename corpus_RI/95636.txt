The amalgamation of the former units in this area took place in 1967 when the market town Olofstrom (itself detached from Jamshog in 1941) was merged with Kyrkhult and Jamshog.
Notable person that Olofstrom counts as theirs is Nobel Prize winning author Harry Martinson (1904-1978; prize in 1974) who was born in Jamshog within the municipality.

The municipality is covered with forests and lakes. It labels itself "The southernmost wildlife in Sweden", probably because there are scarsely any forests or lakes south of the Blekinge province.
The highest point in the province and county of Blekinge, Ravabacken (189,65 m), is located in the northern part of the municipality.
The increased use of cars in the 1950s and 60's was the great boost for the municipality. Today the car industry, dominated by Volvo Cars, is the largest employer in Olofstrom with 2,400 employees, and some more working in other companies connected to this industry. The Volvo industry, with related production, is probably the main reason that the municipality's commuting surplus (as of 2005) is almost 2,000 a day, with many workers coming from the neighboring municipalities of a.o. Bromolla, Karlshamn and Solvesborg.
Vilshult is a small village within the municipality, situated 10&nbsp;km north of the central locality of Olofstrom. It is recognised for a PV (photovoltaic) modules factory that has been located there since 2001.
