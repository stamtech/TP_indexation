Mizrachi was born in Miami, Florida. He is the younger brother of Robert Mizrachi who has numerous WSOP and WPT finishes to his own name. He has a twin brother Eric Mizrachi (also a poker player) and a younger brother, Donnie, who is a professional magician. Mizrachi is fluent in Hebrew, as his father is of Iraqi Jewish origin. Growing up, Mizrachi wanted to become a doctor but dropped out of college to play poker full-time.
Mizrachi is married to Aidiliy, has one son, Paul William (named after his grandfather) and a daughter named Julie Malka ("queen" in Hebrew). He currently lives in Miramar, Florida. He purchased a motor home out of his poker winnings which he used to keep his family near him when he was on the road, but eventually sold it as it was depreciating in value. In early 2010, a federal tax lien in the amount of $339,711 was filed against Mizrachi for unpaid taxes related to his earnings from 2005 to 2007.  Mizrachi also had two residential properties in Florida foreclosed on including a condominium he owned with his brother, Robert.
Mizrachi is a distinguished and successful poker player who in 2006 won CardPlayer Magazine's Player of the Year Award.
Mizrachi got his nickname    The Grinder    for having a solid, consistent style of play; always steadily    grinding    his way through tournament fields.
As of 2010, Mizrachi's live tournament winnings exceed $11,100,000. His 24 cashes at the WSOP account for $4,604,319 of those winnings.
In the 2005 World Series of Poker (WSOP), Mizrachi tied a record by having seven money finishes in the one year. In the 2008 World Series of Poker, he finished third in the $10,000 Pot-Limit Omaha World Championship. In 2010, Mizrachi won his first bracelet in the The Poker Player's Championship, winning $1,559,046.  Conincidentally, his brother Robert Mizrachi finished 5th in the same event. Later that year, Mizrachi also made the November Nine in the Main Event.  He would go on to finish 5th, earning $2,332,992, and was eliminated by eventual winner Jonathan Duhamel.  
In January 2005, Mizrachi finished fifth in the World Poker Tour (WPT) World Poker Open at a table also featuring Daniel Negreanu and Scotty Nguyen. The next month he won a first prize of $1,859,909 at the L.A. Poker Classic, defeating a final table including Ted Forrest and Erick Lindgren. He also finished 11th place(out of 452 entrants) in the $25,000 WPT Championship. 
In the WPT's fourth season he finished second to Scotty Nguyen in the Gold Strike World Poker Open. In the next event, one week later, he won the Borgata Winter Open, defeating a final table including John D'Agostino and Erick Lindgren to win $1,173,373 and a 2006 Cadillac Escalade for his second WPT victory.
Mizrachi starred on the second season of High Stakes Poker.
