Do the wicks of candles contain any poisonous substances, especially ones from say China and Asia, as their rules and regs. aren't as tight as ours?
Thank you.

I have been challenged by my girlfriend to give her a single blue rose that is still alive. I can't dye it and still have it be alive, nor can a rose bush have a single rose. Blue roses symbolize unattainable love, but I know there has to be a way to do this. Any suggestions, however obscure are helpful.    ( ) 18:54, 29 December 2009 (UTC)Lolita_chan
Greetings, great and noble people of the Reference Desk!  article describes a couple who found themselves stuck in the snow for three days in a remote area of Nevada, and unable to call for help because there was no cellular service. Then, according to the article, "one of their cell phones sprang to life and GPSed their co-ordinates to 911". It looks like some kind of technology was used that connected to their phones, even without a typical cell signal, and instructed their phones to forward GPS locations? Is the article accurate, and does anybody know any more details of how this works? &ndash;    21:25, 29 December 2009 (UTC)
