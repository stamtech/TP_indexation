The National Guard was established in August 1991 as a voluntary public military self-defense organization. It   s roots can be traced to a pre-World War II National Guard organization. It is the largest NAF structure in terms of numbers. The National Guard has always played an essential role in the national defense system by allowing the public to be involved in national defense. A number of National Guard battalions have been transformed into high-readiness reserve forces, which can be deployed immediately on international military operations. 
The youth organization of the National Guard, the '''''Jaunsardze''''' (Youth Guards), was established in 1992. It is the largest youth movement in Latvia, bringing together young people from the age of 12 to 18.
An aviation component was introduced in 1993, with a fleet of ex-Soviet DOSAAF light aircraft and gliders. In 2000 the aviation component became part of the Air Force.
The main task of the National Guard is to support the regular Land Force units by defending the national territory during military threat and to perform NAF combat support and combat logistics functions. At the same time, the National Guard will continue providing assistance to the public regarding crisis control, as well as to the State Police regarding provision of public law and order, and continue the safeguarding of sites of national security importance.
