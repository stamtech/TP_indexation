Card Player is also well known for its ''Player of the Year Award''.   Started in 1997, it goes to the player who has the most outstanding tournament results throughout the year.  Players are awarded points for final-table finishes in major tournaments.  Points that can be earned in a given tournament are adjusted based on the buy-in, as well as the number of entrants.  The player who has accumulated the most points at the end of the year receives the prestigious award.
Starting in 2007, Card Player began awarding its Online Player of the Year Award.  The player who accumulates the most points from online tournaments at specified poker websites for a calendar year is recognized as the Online Player of the Year.  Currently the specified poker websites are Absolute Poker, Bodog, Cake Poker, Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars, and Ultimate Bet.  Points are awarded based on the player's tournament finish, the amount of the tournament buy-in and total number of entrants.
In February, 2008, Card Player Media launched SpadeClub.com, an online poker website.  Unlike traditional poker websites, SpadeClub is operated as a sweepstakes and is therefore legal in at least 36 states of the U.S. as well as some other countries.  Members of SpadeClub pay a monthly subscription fee and are able to enter into a variety of free poker tournaments.  The prize pools vary depending upon the number of subscribers.  On September 15, 2010, Spadeclub ceased operations and migrated all users into Zen gaming.
