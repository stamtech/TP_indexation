The '''Palm Treo Pro''' is a combination PDA/cell phone offered in both GSM and CDMA. It is Palm's fourth Windows Mobile Treo. It replaced the short-lived Sprint Treo 800w.
The phone originally was released in an unlocked GSM format. The updated release of the phone for CDMA networks featured new hardware specifications including a more powerful processor, more storage, and less user-available RAM.
The touchscreen is flush with the surface of the phone, a first in the Palm line of products.  The full QWERTY keyboard is in the same style as that of the Palm Centro, with a textured, rubberized feel.  It is roughly 10% wider than the Centro's keyboard.
The familiar sounds on/off switch is located, as expected, on the top of the device.  It switches the phone from having sounds on to a vibrate only mode instantly.
Vodafone (UK) was the first carrier to officially use the Treo Pro.  Also: Telstra (Australia) & Telecom NZ (from May 2009) although the phone is available unlocked as well. M1 (Singapore) began selling the Treo Pro in 2010.
