At the 2008 World Series of Poker, he finished runner-up to Grant Hinkle in Event #2, a $1,500 No Limit Texas hold 'em tournament. He lost the heads-up battle when he managed to provoke Hinkle to put all his chips in with 10 4, an underdog to his AK, only to see the flop come 10 10 4. The fourth 10 on the turn sealed the victory for Hinkle and Akenhead settled for second place and a $520,000 payday.
Akenhead was the only British player to reach the November Nine final table at the 2009 World Series of Poker. He started the final table with the least amount of chips and was knocked out in 9th place by Kevin Schaffel. Akenhead won $1,263,602 for his performance.
In the same year, Akenhead was one of two November Nine members to reach the final table of the World Series of Poker Europe main event, the   10,000 No-Limit Hold 'Em championship, the other member being Antoine Saout. Akenhead was eliminated in 9th place, earning him   66,533 ($109,687).
Akenhead is a regular on the Grosvenor U.K. Poker Tour and finished fourth in the 888.com U.K. Open in 2008 after winning two preliminary heats.
