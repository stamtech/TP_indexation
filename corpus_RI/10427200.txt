I have recently made an out building into a chicken coop and needed electricity during the winter.  It was not cost effective to run hard line out there from the house, so i went with solar.  I bought a 15 watt solar panel, a deep cycle marine battery with a regulater, and a two plug in power inverter.  Got it all hooked up and running just fine.  So here's my problem...currently i have a 10 watt flouresnt bulb thats on a timer for only a few hours during the night.  I would light to put a red 50 watt heat bulb in there and leave it on all night?  How do i find out what would be the max wattage of buld i can run with the current set up, and for how long?  I have looked every where for a "conversion chart" without sucess.  I'm new to this solar thing and need help?     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 03:37, 11 November 2010 (UTC) 
From  about the disabled Carnival cruise ship: ''Gina Calzada, 43, of Henderson, Nev., said her diabetic sister, Vicky Alvarez, called her Wednesday morning on her cell phone and started sobbing. She said she has not been able to take her insulin for her diabetes because she is not eating enough. She told Calzada all that she had eaten was some bread, cucumbers and lettuce. "I told her where are the Pop Tarts and the Spam? I thought they brought in 70,000 pounds of supplies," Calzada said. "She said I haven't seen that."''
Could someone please explain to me the details of this woman's problem. Why can't she take her insulin? Is she in danger, or just inconvenienced? I don't really understand diabetes...   ( ) 05:28, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Best seen from the corner of the eye in the dark. What causes it please?   ( ) 11:16, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Does that mean it is somewhat radioactive?   ( ) 13:18, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

So what exactly is causing the phosphorescence?   ( ) 19:46, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Last night I pulled the plug out of the lamp, so it was completely disconnected, and it still glowed. It had a brighter glow after being unplugged, and must slowly fade.   ( ) 14:50, 12 November 2010 (UTC)
Some researchers have argued that antiparticles are just normal particles travelling backwards in time; positrons are electrons travelling to the past, and so on. Nevertheless, this implies there is an "end of time" from which antiparticles start travelling, just like normal particles start travelling from the "beginning of time". Where is this end of time located? --  ('' '') 12:07, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
To be exact, a 450g (approximately as far as I recall) tin of wild Alaskan pink salmon. Thanks   ( ) 13:23, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Wow, about a week's worth of Vitamin D per 450g tin.   ( ) 19:57, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Are there any scientifically proven methods of increasing a persons memory and recall abilities?     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 16:01, 11 November 2010 (UTC) 
In chemistry (especially organic chemistry), 'R' is used to indicate an uninteresting side branch/structural group in chemical formulae. Our R (disambiguation) notes this, however it does not indicate what 'R' is an abbreviation for. Could someone update the appropriate articles please?   ( ) 17:14, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Which illegal drugs can be used medicinally and where are they actually prescribed to patients for healing diseases. I once heard about this for rheumatic symptoms. I think it was in the UK or US.     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 18:28, 11 November 2010 (UTC) 
I'm not sure this is a Science question per se, but it deals with astronomy-type stuff, so I assume it works best here.  I currently live some 300 miles due east of where I grew up in the same US time zone.  I notice that the sun sets earlier here than it does in my home town.  I'm sure it has something to do with the shape of the earth and all.  My question is, how far east would you need to travel to experience the sun setting 1 minute earlier than it does where you begain?  I know this will depend on the topography (mountains and such), but for the sake of argument, assume the topography is flat.  It seems that the sun sets, I don't know, about 30 minutes earlier here than it does where I grew up.  Is there a way to calculate that or am I forgetting something very trivial that will cause me to feel like an idiot?    ( ) 19:28, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
Thanks, guys.  That formula looks like Greek to me, so I'll just have to go with the rule of thumb.  So, if 15 miles equals to about 1 minute, then 300 miles would be about 20 minutes.  That's pretty close to my recollection.  That's very interesting.  Thank you both!   ( ) 20:22, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
I know that a square-rigged ship with two masts is called a brig, and with three or more a clipper. Is there a name for a square-rig with only one mast? --          19:56, 11 November 2010 (UTC)
