Bank Street was founded in 1916 by Lucy Sprague Mitchell as the "Bureau of Educational Experiments". (Mitchell was the first Dean of Women at the University of California, Berkeley). Its original focus was the study of child development and education, but, after two years, it was clear that actual living subjects, i.e. children, were needed, so in 1918 a nursery school was opened. This nursery school is the direct predecessor of today's School for Children. It wasn't until the 1930s that Bank Street began to formally train teachers, the start of today's Bank Street College of Education.
In 1965, Bank Street developed the "Bank Street Readers" line of books, which were unique due to their featuring of racial diversity and urban people of contemporary culture. Also in the 1960s, the Bank Street faculty played an important role in the creation of the federal Head Start program.
The college gets its name from its former location on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. It moved to its current location in the early 1970s.
