The '''East Lancs Nordic''' is a type of double-decker bus body built by East Lancashire Coachbuilders. It is built on tri-axle 12 metre Volvo B7L and later tri-axle Volvo B9TL chassis, and have around 73 seats.
The body is basically an elongated double-deck Myllennium body, but was offered at first with an elongated Lolyne body. The only examples in the UK are 10 Lolyne-bodied Volvo B7L for First Glasgow and some Myllennium-bodied Volvo B9TLs, one operated by Roadliner of Poole in a green and black livery, and six by Weaveaway in Oxfordshire in a silver livery.
The body is also sold outside of the UK. Arriva Denmark had 14 with Volvo B7L chassis - their only double deckers - in Copenhagen in a yellow livery, under contract to HT (now HUR) which is similar to TfL in London, one was destroyed by fire, the other 13 were transferred to Ensignbus for resale, with at least one being converted to open top and sold to Italy. City Trafik in Copenhagen also have 22 examples with Volvo B7L chassis.
