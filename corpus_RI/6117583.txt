Don't let me get started with flickr. Of these I think about 5 or 10 are better images than the current FP.  Despite the current bias against black & white photography, I think the current nominee is one of them.  Regardless, to say that the current FP represents the finest of WP is a joke.--  ( / / / / )  07:54, 27 March 2008 (UTC)
Of the images above I consider the following better than the current FP although the last four may not be sharp enough and 2 and 3 need to be cropped.--  ( / / / / )  13:44, 27 March 2008 (UTC)
