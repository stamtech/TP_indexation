The advantages from FiOS Digital Voice are a simpler, more efficient operation and less maintenance. Adding or removing phones lines is almost instantaneous and costs little. Technicians do not have to visit sites in order to change different aspects of the service. If the customer already is a FiOS Internet customer, then they can use the Digital Voice service using the same connection. Instead of having to physically install a phone line and jack to a building, the customer only has to add a phone number to their existing account. Home customers will be able use their existing phone jacks to keep installs simple and to use other features like Caller ID. Customers will be able to have both their home and cell phones ring when they are receiving a call.Spangler, T. (2008). FiOS to raise its voice.

Verizon is offering different potential payment plans for their Digital Voice service, including a flat monthly fee or a pay-by-the-minute plan. One source has claimed the unlimited monthly plan costs $44.99 per month and the by-minute plan costs $14.99 per month plus usage charges.  Customers will also be able to order virtual phone numbers at an additional charge.
Other companies such as Vonage have been offering home VoIP services, which competed with land-based phone lines from Verizon. By offering a packaged deal with TV, Internet, and now VoIP, Verizon may be able to attract customers that would have been drawn to a solely VoIP company.
