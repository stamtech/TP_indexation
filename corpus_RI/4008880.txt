The '''Orange County Sheriff's Office''' is the chief law enforcement agency for Orange County, Florida, USA. The office is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the southeastern United States with a budget of more than $180 million dollars and over 2,400 sworn and civilian employees. The current sheriff, Jerry Demings, was elected in 2008 and is the chief law enforcement officer of Orange County responsible for the safety of over 1 million residents and the more than 45 million tourists that visit Orange County each year.
The first sheriff of Orange County dates from the earliest days of Florida's statehood in 1845. On January 31, 1845, the area known as Mosquito County in Territorial Florida was renamed Orange County, a name reflective of the spreading blanket of orange groves throughout the region. Less than six weeks later, on March 3, 1845, Florida's status as a territory was changed to that of statehood. The first statewide election was conducted on May 26, 1845. William Henry Williams was elected to serve as Orange County's first sheriff.
Since 1845, numerous prominent individuals have held the position of the Orange County Sheriff, including David William Mizell. Mizell was the only sheriff killed in the line of duty. There have been numerous theories and tales regarding the story which lead to his demise, ranging from the local tradition of the 'Barber-Mizell feud' to Reconstruction politics to a lawman simply attempting to do his additional duty of levying fines and collecting taxes.
