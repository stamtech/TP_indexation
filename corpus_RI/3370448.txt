It was the first storm of the 1963 season to make landfall along the United States coastline and the first hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960. Cindy brought heavy rainfall across eastern Texas and western Louisiana. The storm also affected Arkansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. The effects of Cindy left $12.5&nbsp;million (1963 USD; $}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) and three fatalities.
Cindy formed on September 16, from a trough of low pressure 200&nbsp;miles (322&nbsp;km) east-northeast of Brownsville, Texas. Shortly thereafter, a ship reported tropical storm force winds, prompting forecasters at the National Hurricane Center to name the storm ''Cindy''. The storm tracked north-northwest near , and continued at near that speed and direction for almost 24&nbsp;hours. By 1800 UTC an eye was detected on radar as the storm was located 200&nbsp;miles (322&nbsp;km) east of Corpus Christi. Early on September 17, Cindy intensified enough to be upgraded to hurricane status. This was based on the ship ''SS Sabine'' reporting hurricane force winds near the center of circulation. Simultaneously, Cindy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .   
Intensity leveled-off slightly after Cindy attained peak intensity, with winds dropping to minimal hurricane status. Later on September 17, Cindy made landfall near Port Arthur, Texas with winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). After landfall, the storm stalled out over eastern Texas for 18&nbsp;hours before drifting slowly westward. The southwestward drift caused Cindy to rapidly weaken to a weak tropical storm on September 18 and later to a tropical depression a day later. After drifting slowly for two days over southeastern Texas, Cindy finally dissipated on September 20 northwest of Brownsville.
The U.S. Weather Bureau office in New Orleans issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch from Freeport, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana in its second advisory. In its next advisory, the tropical storm warnings were changed to hurricane warnings as Cindy reached hurricane status. The warnings were extended to include Galveston, Texas and Vermillion Bay, Louisiana and small boats were told to remain in port while shipping traffic in the path of Hurricane Cindy were warned of the deteriorating conditions. Inland, the Weather Bureau stated in their advisory that flood warnings would be issued since the storm was forecast to bring heavy rain to eastern Texas and western Louisiana. In Lake Charles, Louisiana, forecasters advised residents to take preparations and evacuate in anticipation that Cindy would cause flooding in low-lying areas. Another Weather Bureau center in Corpus Christi, Texas, stated in its advisory that Cindy was no threat to the city as the center of the storm was moving northeastward. However, the Bureau warned residents about the threat of high surf along the southeastern Texas coast. A weather station in Galveston issued gale warnings and meteorologists predicted that the storm would bring high tides and squalls five feet above normal to the city. The Galveston weather center also advised residents to go to storm shelters until the rough seas subsided.
Forecasters at the Weather Bureau forecast center in Port Arthur, Texas, predicted that Cindy would bring tides four feet above normal and advised residents in Port Arthur to take precautionary measures. In its 0000 UTC (7:00 p.m. CST) advisory on September 17, forecasters expected the flooding from Hurricane Cindy to be limited to coastal sections of Port Arthur and not significantly affect inland areas stretching from the Intercoastal Channel Bridge to the Sabine Pass Highway. In addition, forecasters predicted that the storm would bring severe thunderstorms and tornadoes and thus prompted a tornado watch in a 60&nbsp;mile (97&nbsp;km) radius, stretching from College Station, Texas to Lafayette, Louisiana.
Making landfall as a category 1 hurricane, Cindy left $12.5&nbsp;million (1963; $}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) most of it from flooding and three fatalities from drowning incidents.
The outer rainbands of Hurricane Cindy produced torrential downpours along the Louisiana coast. Rainfall of 7-10&nbsp;inches (177.8   254&nbsp;mm) was reported across southeastern Louisiana. Inland, rainfall of 1-3&nbsp;inches (25.4-76.2&nbsp;mm) was reported. Four weather stations in Cameron, Louisiana received 2.21-5.5&nbsp;inches (50.8   127&nbsp;mm) of rain on September 17 and 2.5-4.1&nbsp;inches (50.8-101.6&nbsp;mm) the next day. On the same day, Cameron's local newspaper reported winds gusting to 45&nbsp;mph (72&nbsp;km/h) and a tide gauge reported sea levels  above normal. In Lake Charles, a weather station reported 4.07&nbsp;inches (101.6&nbsp;mm) of rain over a three day span and winds of 23&nbsp;mph (37&nbsp;km/h), gusting to 35&nbsp;mph (56&nbsp;km/h). The weather station also reported a pressure reading of . In Lafayette, the airport reported rainfall of 1.2&nbsp;inches (25.4&nbsp;mm) on September 17. In addition, the airport reported winds of 28&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) and a barometric pressure of .
The heavy rainfall caused extensive flooding along the Louisiana coastline as floodwaters covered two highways leading away from the coastline and caused Calcasieu River to overflow its banks.  Elsewhere in Louisiana, there was moderate damage to roads and crops. Offshore, an oil worker drowned after falling off a lifeboat while evacuating personnel from two oil rigs.
In Texas, the eye of Hurricane Cindy made landfall between the towns of Galveston and Port Arthur, with the eye passing over High Island at 0000 UTC (7 a.m. CDT). Offshore, sustained winds were clocked at 80&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h) while a weather station in Galveston reported sustained winds of 54&nbsp;mph (87&nbsp;km/h) with gusts up to 74&nbsp;mph (119&nbsp;km/h). A tide gauge in Galveston reported water levels  above normal. Damage in Galveston-Sabine Pass area was limited to piers and small boats. In addition, strong winds caused moderate roof damage in Gilchrist and Winnie. As the storm moved inland, it produced heavy rainfall across central, interior portions of south Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. In Deweyville, the storm dropped rainfall that totaled up to 23&nbsp;inches (584.2&nbsp;mm) over a three day period. Storm totals ranging 20.15-23.50&nbsp;inches (508-584.2&nbsp;mm) were reported in other counties in Texas. The heavy rainfall caused severe flooding in much of the inland counties in Texas. In Jefferson County, a levee protecting a suburb of Port Arthur broke on the morning of September 18 but was under control hours later. Volunteer workers packed over 50,000 sandbags to reinforce the levee to preventing it from breaking further. Another canal however overflowed its banks causing moderate flooding that covered Highway 365 and inundated a few homes. In Beaumont, floodwaters inundated 2,000 homes. Overall, damage in Jefferson County amounted to $9.18&nbsp;million (1963 USD; $}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). The flooding also killed two people.{{cite web|author=Robert B.

Newton County sustained only $125,000 (1963 USD; ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|125000|1963}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) in flood damage because, most of the rainwater ran off into the Sabine River.

Oklahoma received moderate to heavy rainfall from the outer bands of Cindy. The highest rainfall total in Oklahoma was at Saddle Mountain where a rain gauge reported rainfall of 5.65&nbsp;inches (500&nbsp;mm) over a four day period although that report was incomplete. The town of Carnegie also reported rainfall of 5&nbsp;inches (127&nbsp;mm). Elsewhere in Oklahoma, rainfall between 1-3&nbsp;inches (25.4-76.2&nbsp;mm), much of it concentrated in the central and southwestern portion of the state. The heavy rainfall caused moderate flooding which forced an evacuation of 300&nbsp;people and damaged 90 homes and businesses. A damage figure in Oklahoma was unknown.
In Arkansas, the effects from Cindy was minimal and limited to light rainfall, the highest rainfall from Cindy was 0.55&nbsp;inches (13.9&nbsp;mm) near El Dorado, Arkansas. Elsewhere, the storm dropped 0.04-0.40&nbsp;inches (1.01&nbsp;mm-10.1&nbsp;mm) of rain. There was no reported damage from Cindy's impact on Arkansas.
Cindy dropped rainfall as far east as the border of Mississippi and Alabama. Much of it was light rainfall, with many areas of Mississippi reporting  of precipitation. However, in the extreme southwestern portion of the state, heavier rainfall was reported, and peaked between  in Hancock County.
President John F. Kennedy declared much of eastern and central Texas a disaster area on September 24, 1963. The declaration allowed state and local governments to receive federal aid.
