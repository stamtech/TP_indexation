The name is derived from the fact that it permits the user to operate the device while on board a commercial aircraft while in flight, where the operation of cell phones and other devices that send or receive signals is generally prohibited due to the potential impact on aircraft avionics and the potential for interference with ground cell networks. Other names include '''airplane mode''', '''offline mode''', and '''standalone mode'''. 
FM Receiver, Bluetooth, wireless LAN antenna and GPS should still be operative if the phone is so equipped.  Many models, including most Apple products, disable GPS and some of the other features, although this is inconsistent among manufacturers, since these latter functions are permitted on some aircraft and not others.  Nevertheless, certain airlines specifically prohibit the use of devices with a 'Flight mode' at all times.
