In April 2003 at the "D: All Things Digital" executive conference, Jobs expressed his belief that tablet PCs and traditional PDAs were not good choices as high-demand markets for Apple to enter, despite many requests made to him that Apple create another PDA. He did believe that cell phones were going to become important devices for portable information access, and that what cell phones needed to have was excellent synchronization software. At the time, instead of focusing on a follow-up to their Newton PDA, Jobs had Apple put its energies into the iPod, and the iTunes software (which can be used to synchronize content with iPod devices), released January 2001. On September 7, 2005, Apple and Motorola released the ROKR E1, the first mobile phone to use iTunes. Jobs was unhappy with the ROKR, feeling that having to compromise with a non-Apple designer (Motorola) prevented Apple from designing the phone they wanted to make. In September 2006, Apple discontinued support for the ROKR and released a version of iTunes that included references to an as-yet unknown mobile phone that could display pictures and video.Chen, Jason. , ''Gizmodo'', (2006-09-27) On January 9, 2007, Jobs announced the iPhone at the Macworld convention, receiving substantial media attention,Mather, John. , ''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', (2007-02-19) and on June 11, 2007 announced at the Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference that the iPhone would support third-party applications using the Safari engine on the device.

Press release Such applications appeared even before the release of the iPhone; the first being "OneTrip", a program meant to keep track of the user's shopping list., ''MacRumors, (2007-06-13) On June 29, 2007, Apple released version 7.3 of iTunes to coincide with the release of the iPhone., ''PC World'', (2007-06-29) This release contains support for iPhone service activation and syncing.
According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', the iPhone is manufactured on contract in the Shenzhen factory of the Taiwanese company Hon Hai., ''The Wall Street Journal'', 2007-08-11.
The first advertisement for iPhone, titled "Hello," aired during the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007 on ABC. The ad features clips from several notable films and television shows over the last seventy years, showing iconic characters answering telephones and saying "hello" or a similar greeting. The iPhone is shown at the end with the caption "Hello. Coming in June."
The commercial was created by TBWA\Chiat\Day, Apple's ad agency since CEO Steve Jobs' return to the company in 1998. TBWA's Media Arts Lab will continue to handle all upcoming advertising for iPhone, much as it has for iPod.
On June 3, 2007, Apple released four advertisements announcing a June 29, 2007 release date. A fifth ad featuring YouTube was released on June 21, 2007. All five advertisements feature a voice over describing various iPhone features, demonstrated on-screen. The song "Perfect Timing (This Morning)" by Orba Squara plays in the background.
The first publicly released iPhone 3G ad was first shown at WWDC 2008. Since then, iPhone 3G ads have been similar to those of the original iPhone; however, the background is white and the music used is "You, Me, and the Bourgeoisie" by The Submarines and can be viewed on Apple's website.
One iPhone television advertisement was banned in the UK after the Advertising Standards Authority decided that the ad made false claims about the device's ability to access websites, and did not mention limitations in doing so.
In April 2009, iPhone commercials started to showcase applications as part of its "There's an app for that" campaign.
On July 1, 2007, it was reported that Apple paid at least US$1 million to Michael Kovatch for the transfer of the iphone.com domain name. Kovatch registered the domain in 1995. That URL now redirects to Apple's iPhone page.
On June 28, 2007, during an address to Apple employees, Steve Jobs announced that all full-time Apple employees and those part-time employees that have been with the company at least one year would receive a free iPhone. Employees received their phones in July after the initial demand subsided.
Initially priced at US$599 and US$499 for the 8&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB models, the iPhone went on sale on June 29, 2007. Apple closed its stores at 2:00&nbsp;PM local time to prepare for the 6:00&nbsp;PM iPhone launch, while hundreds of customers lined up at stores nationwide.
Currently, in the U.S. and some other countries it can only be acquired with a credit card precluding a completely anonymous purchase. There is no way to opt out of the data plan. The iPhone at first could not be added to an AT&T Business account, and any existing business account discounts cannot be applied to an iPhone AT&T account, which AT&T changed in late January 2008.
The Associated Press also reported that some users were unable to activate their phones because, according to AT&T, "high volume of activation requests were taxing the company's computer servers."
Early estimates by technology analysts estimated sales of between 250,000 to 700,000 units in the first weekend alone, with strong sales continuing after the initial weekend. As part of their quarterly earnings announcement, AT&T reported that 146,000 iPhones were activated in the first weekend. Though this figure does not include units that were purchased for resale on eBay or otherwise not activated until after the opening weekend, it is still less than most initial estimates. It is also estimated that 95% of the units sold are the 8&nbsp;GB model.
On January 11, 2011, Verizon announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10, 2011. By contrast, T-Mobile USA's inability to provide the iPhone to customers raised its subscription churn rate, put the unit in an "unsustainable position", and contributed to parent Deutsche Telekom's decision to sell it to AT&T in March 2011.
Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press a little more than a month after the iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release.
 Those who had purchased an iPhone in the 14-day period before the September 5, 2007 announcement were eligible for a US$200 "price protection" rebate from Apple or AT&T. However, it was widely reported that some who bought between the June 29, 2007 launch and the August 22, 2007 price protection kick-in date complained that this was a larger-than-normal price drop for such a relatively short period and accused Apple of unfair pricing.
In response to customer complaints, on September 6, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote in an open letter to iPhone customers that everyone who purchased an iPhone at the higher price "and who is not receiving a rebate or other consideration", would receive a US$100 credit to be redeemed towards the purchase of any product sold in Apple's retail or online stores.
With the July 11, 2008 release of the iPhone 3G, Apple and AT&T changed the U.S. pricing model from the previous generation. Following the   model for mobile phone service in the United States, AT&T will subsidize a sizable portion of the upfront cost for the iPhone 3G followed by charging moderately higher monthly fees over a minimum two year contract.
On November 9, 2007, iPhone was officially launched in Europe in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the UK, sales are going through the UK O2 unit of Telefonica, while in Germany, it is offered through Deutsche Telekom   s T-Mobile division. Similar to the previous launch in U.S. customers lined up as much as a day in advance to get hold of the much anticipated phone.
However, the initial operating model locking iPhone owners to one selected carrier have been controversial in Europe. In Germany, a competing operator, Vodafone, brought the case for court claiming that the arrangement was against German law. On November 20, 2007, an interim court order resulted in the locked iPhone sales in Germany to be temporarily stopped.
It is currently unclear how this situation will continue to develop in Europe. The iPhone launch in France a few weeks later through the operator Orange, facing the same legal issues. Other countries that will pose the same problems for the locked iPhone business model include Belgium, Italy, Finland, and Brazil.
On December 1, 2007, Tusmobil, Slovenian mobile operator, started selling "unlocked" iPhones without an official contract with Apple. The offer caused a lot of confusion with Apple Europe, local media, and local Apple representatives.
On May 6, 2008, Telecom Italia announced that it has signed a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone in Italy
On May 27, 2008, TeliaSonera released a press release stating that it will start selling the iPhone in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia during 2008.
On June 4, 2008, Movistar announced that it has signed a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone in Spain
On August 22, 2008, EMT, Estonian mobile operator, started selling iPhones.

On September 26, 2008, Omnitel released iPhones in the Lithuania.
On November 7, 2008, T-Mobile released iPhones in Croatia.
On September 30, 2010 Elisa released iPhone 4 in Finland.
The iPhone 4 is available unlocked from the Apple Store for $859.00 (16GB) and $999 (32GB), as well as on contract from Optus, Telstra, Vodafone, Three and Virgin Mobile (all the major carriers). It is considered against the Australian Trade Pratices Act to grant exclusive rights to a single carrier as was the case in the USA with AT&T having exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in North America for some time.
The very first iPhone 3G model released on July 11, 2008 was sold in Auckland, New Zealand to 22 year old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01am NZST. The iPhone is available to customers on the Vodafone network. There was much criticism from New Zealand customers when Vodafone announced their pricing for the iPhone. The first generation of iPhones has been available for sale in New Zealand through parallel import stores since the phones originally went on sale in the US, the original 2G models available for sale in New Zealand have been unlocked for use on the Vodafone network and can be used with any plan including pre-paid plans.
It is likely that in the near future rival phone network Telecom New Zealand will sell iPhones to be used on the Telecom XT Network.
After months of high anticipation, the first iPhone to be released in Canada was the iPhone 3G. Rogers Wireless began offering 8&nbsp;GB and 16&nbsp;GB models on July 11, 2008. Faced a public backlash, Rogers dropped the price of its service plan from CA$100 to CA$30 per month.
The iPhone 3GS with the new iPhone 3.0 operating system was released in Canada by Rogers Wireless on June 19, 2009. Users who signs up for a 3 years agreement with a data optioncould choose between a 16&nbsp;GB device for CA$199 and a 32&nbsp;GB device for CA$299.
Bell and Telus Mobility announced their release of the iPhone on the 4th and 5 November 2009, respectively
On May 6, 2008, Vodafone announced that they signed a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone in Australia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Italy, India, Portugal, New Zealand, South Africa, and Turkey.
Subsequent announcements confirmed that Apple is moving away from exclusive one-carrier deals. Soon after Vodafone's announcement, TIM announced it would also be selling the iPhone in Italy, on May 12, 2008 Optus confirmed it would sell it in Australia and SingTel confirmed that it would be selling the iPhone in India through its Indian Joint Venture, Airtel.
On June 4, 2008, SoftBank Mobile released a press release stating that it will start selling the iPhone in Japan during 2008.
Russia's second largest mobile operator Beeline announced on August 28, 2008 that they signed a contract with Apple to enter Russian market by the late 2008. This deal is rumoured to be non-exclusive according to the unofficial statements made by some officials in two remaining mobile operators that belong to so-called Russia's Big Three     MTS and MegaFon - to enter iPhone 3G on Russian market simultaneously with Beeline. As it was predicted, MegaFon issued the press release about the same deal on September 2, 2008. MTS, the largest mobile network of Russia and CIS still hasn't released any statement.
On November 14, 2008, Vodafone Egypt and Mobinil started selling the iPhone 3G in Egypt. This comes after Vodafone's deal with Apple Inc. earlier in May. The iPhone 3G is priced at EG  3,800 and EG  4,600 for the 8&nbsp;GB and 16&nbsp;GB models respectively. Customers must also sign up for one of 3 service plans to accompany the phone.
On September 28, 2009, Orange UK announced that they were to become the second operator of the iPhone in the UK, ending an exclusive deal O2 had done since 2007. Orange later announced that the iPhone will be released on November 10, with pricing plans starting from   29.36 on contract and   440 for the 3GS 16GB on pay as you go. On the following day, Vodafone UK also announced that they will be selling the iPhone by early 2010, becoming the third UK network and Vodafone's 11th country to offer the iPhone.
There has been ongoing speculation in the United States that Apple may offer a CDMA-compatible iPhone for Verizon Wireless. This speculation increased on October 6, 2010, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple would begin producing a CDMA-compatible iPhone, with such a model going on sale in early 2011. 
On January 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that Verizon Wireless would officially announce on January 11, 2011 the launch of a CDMA-based iPhone for use on their network. The date in which the Verizon iPhone will go on sale is unknown, though the two most recent iPhone releases were made available within weeks of their launch announcement. Verizon confirmed the announcement on January 11, with an on-sale date of February 10.
On January 11, 2011, Verizon announced that they would be carrying a CDMA version of Apple's iPhone 4 starting in February 2011.  Existing Verizon Wireless customers will be able to pre-order the iPhone on February 3 and everyone else will be able to order it on February 10.  Pricing for the iPhone 4 is $199 for 16GB and $299 for 32GB.
The international release of the iPhone has been staggered over several months. Today, the iPhone is available in most countries.
The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone through AT&T or O2. On July 3, 2007, Jon Lech Johansen reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with jailbreaking. He published the software and offsets for others to use.
On August 14, 2007, Gizmodo reported verification of a method to bypass the iPhone's SIM lock, allowing the phone to work freely with carriers other than AT&T. This method requires a Turbo SIM card costing approximately US$80 and essentially tricks the iPhone into believing that it is operating on the AT&T network even when it is connected natively (not in roaming mode) to another carrier. Australian Personal Computer later published a ten-step guide to unlocking the iPhone using the Turbo SIM method.
In mid-August, UniquePhones announced an unlocking service for the iPhone, only to retract the service the following week after receiving a phone call from a lawyer representing AT&T.
On August 24, 2007, George Hotz, a 17-year-old hacker from Glen Rock, New Jersey, broke the lock that ties Apple's iPhone to AT&T's wireless network. He confirmed that he unlocked the phone and was using it on T-Mobile's network. The hack opened up a realm of possibilities for overseas customers because the iPhone was only sold in the U.S at the time. By unlocking it, Hotz opened up the phone to all kinds of phone networks across the world. Hotz posted the hack on his blog. The process is complicated and requires both disassembling the iPhone and executing software commands on a personal computer. Hotz, along with four others across the world, reportedly spent about 500 hours to unlock the phone.
Also, on August 24, 2007, Engadget reported, by way of photos and a video clip, that they were called by the "iPhoneSimFree" team to view a demonstration of unlocking the iPhone using a software-only solution. Unlike Hotz's hardware hack, the code in this hack was not made available to the general public. Sales of the unlock started on September 10, by way of several resellers who were able to order "keys" from iPhoneSimFree which are then passed onto the customer to use the software.
After only one full day of sales, early on September 11 the iPhone Dev Team announced that they had also created a working "software unlock", and released it to the public for free. Utilizing the existing unlock requires some technical knowledge, although a GUI-based version was under construction. Two free, GUI-based unlocking programs that have been made available are AnySim and iUnlock Reloaded.
On September 24, 2007 Apple issued a warning that future updates could render unlocked iPhones unusable. On September 27, 2007, owners of unlocked iPhones who took advantage of the version 1.1.1 update through iTunes reported that the update rendered the device virtually inoperable. There were also reports that the update even affected some iPhones that were not unlocked, and Engadget found that the firmware update had "bricked" unhacked iPhones as well. The firmware update relocks iPhones, but on October 11 the iPhoneSIMFree announced that they had hacked the 1.1.1 iPhone update, not only unlocking them but also unbricking those iPhones which were bricked by the update.
On October 16, 2007, the iPhoneDevTeam released AnySIM 1.1, the free utility that unlocks iPhones. The updated version works on firmware version 1.1.1, but doesn't fix baseband problems caused by updating an unlocked 1.0.2 phone up to 1.1.1.
On October 23, 2007, the iPhone Elite Dev-Team released Revirginizing Tool to rebuild the lock table in the seczone area to repair the damage done by the original anySIM 1.0x unlockers so unlocked 1.0.2 iPhones can upgrade to 1.1.1 without bricking the iPhone. The tool is unbricking the previously bricked iPhones.
On November 21, 2007, T-Mobile announced that due to litigation commenced against them by their competitor Vodafone, which resulted in a preliminary injunction preventing T-Mobile from locking the SIM card to T-Mobile in Germany, it will sell the phone "unlocked" and will offer the iPhone without a T-Mobile contract for    999 (US$1,478) at its shops to customers in Germany until the court renders a decision.
During the end of November, Apple released another version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.2. This version does not have many new features, but breaks unlocks.
During Macworld '08, on January 15, Apple released a fifth version of iPhone firmware, 1.1.3; this version repairs loopholes used by "iPhone Hackers." The firmware however had been compromised prior to release and new security measures were quickly bypassed.
On February 8, 2008 Geohot released the first full software unlock for the 1.1.2 & 1.1.3 OTB iPhones.
