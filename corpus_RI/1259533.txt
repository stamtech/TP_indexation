Nic's father, who used to play draw poker himself, was a rear gunner who went missing during World War II.
He began playing in 1962 during college, where he ran a game from his room. He was eventually asked to leave due to a French au pair being in his bed.
He formed his own newspaper and magazine publishing group in 1979 and sold it in 1989.
At the age of 47, he found it difficult to get work, so bought a betting office. It lost money despite a reasonable turnover, yet was sold at a profit.
In 1995 he was made secretary of the European Poker Players' Association. He was permanently on the poker circuit until 1998 when he began editing ''Poker Europa'' magazine. Around the same time he created ''Late Night Poker'', although he eventually left the show due to a money dispute and disagreement about the show's direction.
He also helped create the World Heads-Up Poker Championship.
Nic has played poker in over 10 countries to date.
His daughter Kate, a former piano teacher, also plays poker.
As of 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceed $190,000
