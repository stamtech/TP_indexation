 Large hydroelectric systems can be even less expensive by this measure; the Three Gorges Dam is reported to have cost   180 billion (US$26 billion), about $1 a watt, but actual costs are widely believed to be much higher. Solar panels are currently selling for as low as just over $1 a watt in industrial quantities, but the "balance of system" costs put the systems closer to $4 to $5 a watt. Large wind turbines are around $8 a watt and falling. Natural gas-fired peaking power plants are around $6 a watt.
Note that the capital costs are not the only determinant of the cost of the electricity produced. A coal plant needs to burn coal to produce power, while a solar panel has no fuel input at all. Maintenance, replacement, fuel costs and capacity factor all effect the cents per kilowatt hour of the power plant's delivered electricity.
