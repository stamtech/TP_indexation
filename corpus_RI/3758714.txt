The '''Volvo B10L''' is a rear-engined, low-floor single-deck city bus chassis built by Volvo between c. 1993 and c. 2005. An articulated version of the B10L, known as the '''B10LA''', was also produced.
It was available in the United Kingdom and Ireland between 1994 and 1999, with a choice of two types of bodywork, the Alexander (Belfast) Ultra and the Wright Liberator. The Alexander Ultra body was based on the Swedish design produced by Saffle (a subsidiary of Volvo), who built the body on the first B10L imported to Britain. The Wright bodywork proved slightly more popular.
In the UK, the articulated B10LA was bodied exclusively by Wrights for First subsidiaries in Manchester (15), Leeds (15) and Glasgow (10). The Wright body for the B10LA is named Fusion.
The B10L enjoyed limited success in Britain. In 1997 the Volvo B10BLE was introduced to the British market, and this chassis rapidly became more popular. The B10BLE was cheaper than the B10L, and shared more in common with the step-entrance B10B, examples of which were already owned by many of its customers.
Other UK operators who purchased B10Ls include:
The pioneer Saffle-bodied B10L was new to Mainline (now First South Yorkshire) but they did not order any further examples and quickly disposed of it. As of November 2006 it was being used around Lincoln by Stagecoach subsidiary RoadCar. Ironically, the 15 Wright-bodied examples in the FirstGroup are all due to be transferred to First South Yorkshire.
Eleven Wright-bodied B10Ls are operated by Bus Eireann in Cork, and sister CIE company Dublin Bus purchased five Alexander-bodied B10Ls for use in Dublin. A sixth, experimental LPG-powered, vehicle was leased and later returned.
