The '''Canadian national men's basketball team''' represents Canada in international basketball competitions. The team is currently coached by Leo Rautins and is ranked 19th by FIBA. Athletes for this team are selected by Canada Basketball. The current NBA players on the roster are Joel Anthony of the Miami Heat and Andy Rautins of the New York Knicks, although Matt Bonner of the San Antonio Spurs has recently obtained Canadian citizenship and plans to play for Canada.
