The '''East Lancs Myllennium''' is a type of bus body built on MAN, Volvo, DAF/VDL and Alexander Dennis chassis. It was built as a single and double deck body, with double deck bodies having slightly different names (see below).
The single-deck version of the body was built on DAF SB220 and Alexander Dennis Dart chassis. This body is called the Myllennium regardless of the chassis. The body was replaced by the Esteem. It was designed in 1999 as a bus for the Millennium routes M1 & M2 from the Millennium Dome but soon after became available for other operators.
The Hyline body is used to re-body reconditioned Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M chassis. Six Leyland Tigers were rebodied in 2000 as Myllennium Hylines for Strathtay. The concept was not a great success, as a result no further orders followed - the Hylines representing the end in the UK of rebodying for the bus industry. It was like Myllennium single-decker but for high-floor buses, it could not be ordered with any new, low floor chassis.
In line with previous East Lancs products, the Myllennium bodywork was used to body less standard buses than public service vehicles (PSVs). Notable examples include the BBC radio buses, in various places around the United Kingdom.
The double-deck version of the Myllennium was built on a Volvo B7TL, DAF/VDL DB250 or Alexander Dennis Trident 2 chassis. The body could be built as covered, open-top or convertible open-top. It is the only convertible double-decker body available in the UK. The body was replaced by the Olympus and the Visionaire (open top). The full names are:
