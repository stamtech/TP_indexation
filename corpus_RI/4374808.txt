Piatt had a successful college career at Mississippi State University, helping lead the Bulldogs to multiple NCAA Tournament appearances. Piatt led the MSU team in 1996 with a .370 batting average. Piatt played mostly at 3rd base for MSU and was named to the 2nd team All-Southeastern Conference unit in 1997, when the Bulldogs reached the College World Series. He chose to leave school early after that, and signed a pro contract.
Piatt's best year was 1999 when he won the triple crown and minor league player of the year award at 3rd base. He was forced into becoming an outfielder because of the A's present third baseman, Eric Chavez, and that was the only opening on the A's. He hit .299 in 60 games in 2000 with 5 home runs and 5 triples. In 2001, he got viral meningitis, but fortunately survived. He was designated for assignment by the A's in August 2003 and was claimed off waivers by Tampa Bay. In 2004, he went to Cleveland, but retired before the season.
Piatt was once featured in a commercial for K-Swiss shoes.
In the Mitchell Report, Piatt admitted to having used steroids. He also claimed to have sold testosterone or Deca-Durabolin, along with human growth hormone to then Oakland teammate Miguel Tejada. He never saw Tejada actually use any substances. Piatt had checks from Tejada published in the Mitchell Report dated from 2003 for $3,100 and $3,200. Piatt said that former A's teammate F. P. Santangelo had told him about a guy who could give Piatt HGH. Piatt (who was trying to come back from viral meningitis) received HGH and testosterone from Kirk Radomski and used them in the 2002-2003 offseason. After using them he said he "did not love the game when he used them" and that he had learned a life lesson. Piatt told all of this to Mitchell during their meeting. 
In June of 2009, Piatt was charged with possession of marijuana not more than 20 grams and or use of narcotic equipment, DUI and DUI with property damage in Cape Coral, Florida.
