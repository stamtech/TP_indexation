The anniversary editions were only available in either Globetrotter or Globetrotter XL variants in metallic paint with silver livery and decor stripes featuring a special anniversary theme. The unique interior design continued the theme with custom textiles mats and generous use of leather.
Both 13 and 16 litre engines were available. Both of the engines were coupled to I-shift transmission. Electronic Stability Program (ESP) and Electronic disc Brake System (EBS) were also standard.
The anniversary models were the first Volvo trucks available with Lane Keeping Support as well as with Adaptive Cruise Control systems. Standard equipment included the usual features  such as central locking, electric windows, tinted glass and a premium sound system.
