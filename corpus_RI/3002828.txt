The '''Samsung SGH-T809''' is a mobile telephone released by Samsung and increasingly common in the United States due to a distribution deal with T-Mobile. It is also known in some countries  as the Samsung D820. 
The phone is noted as having a sleek and glossy texture. The speakers are of especially high quality for a cell phone, and photos taken with the built-in camera can be edited with imaging tools contained within the device. However, battery life is no different than any other cell phone with these capabilities and the buttons are sometimes too small for precision use if you don't have normal size hands.

The phone has been distributed in North America by the following carriers:
