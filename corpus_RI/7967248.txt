The original recording of "Midnight Confessions" was a demo by the Evergreen Blues Band, whose manager     Lou Josie     wrote the song. The demo contained a horn section and caught the attention of Record producer/engineer Steve Barri, who was looking to produce a song for the Grass Roots that was a "West Coast" version of a Motown-style production. The Grass Roots version was produced/engineered by Steve Barri with the horn section's arrangement by Jimmie Haskell. The performers included  bassist-vocalist Rob Grill, guitarists Creed Bratton and Warren Entner, drummer Rick Coonce, and various session musicians.
