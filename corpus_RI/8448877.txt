DubaiSat will return imagery of the Earth which the Emirati government will use to help plan future land development programmes. It will relay these images to a ground station in Dubai which was built by ViaSat. The satellite has a mass of around , and a design life of five years. It is controlled by a three-axis stabilisation system, with pointing accuracy of 0.2 degrees. Its power system consists of three deployable solar panels charging three 6&nbsp;Ah nickel-cadmium batteries. The solar panels are predicted to generate  of power at the beginning of the satellite's operational life, and  of power at the end.
