BIA/OC   s Mission is to champion housing as a core component of viable communities.
The Building Industry Association of Southern California was originally established in 1923 as the Building Contractors Association (BCA). It was then reorganized under the same name to become a    State    organization with chapters in various communities. The Orange County chapter was chartered in 1939. In 1945, the chapter was revoked and replaced with three separate chapters within the Orange County area: Central OC, North OC, and the South Coast Chapter. A year later, in 1946, the Builder-Developer Chapter withdrew from the BCA and formed the Home Builders Association of Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura Counties (HBA). By 1960, the three separate Orange County chapters had remerged with each other becoming the Orange County Chapter once again in 1960. In 1967, the HBA and BCA were consolidated into Building Industry Association of California, Inc., where the name was eventually changed in 1978 to the Building Industry Association of Southern California.
