Transit 5E-1 was launched for studying charged particles, magnetic fields and solar spectra, as well as doing geodetic research.
It was launched to a polar orbit, from where it did geomagnetic and geodetic measurements. Electrical power was produced by four solar panels. After August 1969, the satellite did measurements infrequently. The last data were transmitted in November, 1974.
