The ''Sapulpa Daily Herald'' gained national media attention in early November 2008 for not reporting the election of Barack Obama as President, reporting only that John McCain had won among the voters of Creek County.  Critics charged that the omission related to racism, as Obama's victory as the first African American elected president was an historic event. The newspaper maintains that it only covers local news events.
The town was named after Chief Sapulpa, the area's first permanent settler, who was a full-blood Lower Creek Indian of the Kasihta Tribe from Osocheetown, Alabama. In about 1850, he established a trading post near the meeting of Polecat and Rock creeks (about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) southeast of present-day downtown Sapulpa).
Sapulpa is notable as the home of Frankoma Pottery,   and Happy Burger.
