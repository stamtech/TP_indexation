Yahoo launched PayDirect in March 2000 after purchasing Athas, a provider of electronic billing services. Athas' dotBank.com service allowed customers to make online bill payments and to exchange money with other customers. When Yahoo! took over the site, the accounts were managed by international bank HSBC.
In 2000, Yahoo extended the Yahoo! PayDirect service to mobile phones, as part of its Yahoo Everywhere initiative. 
The Yahoo! PayDirect service was discontinued effective November 22, 2004, leaving only a web page () showing "The PayDirect service and web site is closed and now unavailable."
