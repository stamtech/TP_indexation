The total cost of the project is US$100 million, 80% of which is being provided by NSPO, and the remainder by various U.S. agencies.
After experiencing several delays, the launch of the COSMIC satellite constellation atop a Minotaur launch vehicle from Vandenberg AFB occurred at 01:40 GMT, on April 15, 2006, despite heavy fog. The satellites, which orbit at an altitude of 500 miles, required over a year to move into the correct positions to provide full global coverage.
The COSMIC satellites are be equipped with three primary forms of instrumentation for remote sensing, including:
All 6 microsatellites were launched on a single launch vehicle and deployed into a single parking orbit after launch. The spacecraft were then deployed into separate orbital planes through the use of precession due to the oblateness of the Earth and raised to a final orbital altitude over the course of several months. Scientific data were collected during the deployment process, along with experimental validation and calibration.
Currently only four of the microsatellites remain fully functional.  The FM2's power system lost 50% of its output in February 2007, while FM3's solar panel also malfunctioned since August 2007. As a result, both satellites are operating in a degraded state, capable of returning data only during specific  solar angles.  The FM6 went out of control on September 2007, but control was restored by November 16 of the same year.
FM3 had severe power problem since July 6 2010. It is declared no function since them. FM4, FM5, and FM6 has battery aging problem. So right now FM1 is the only FM remains fully functional.
