The daily haiku from tinywords.com are designed to be under 160 characters, including headers, to fit the limits of most SMS devices, although messages are occasionally sent as links to longer poems. tinywords has subscription instructions for users of the major US cell phone carriers and SMS services. There is also a  that shows how to figure out your cell phone's email address based on its phone number.
