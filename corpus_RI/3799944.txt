The '''Volvo B12B''' is a rear-engined coach and intercity bus chassis built by Volvo. It is built as a direct replacement of Volvo B12 in the European market and the Volvo B10B.
The B12B could be fitted with Volvo DH12C (later DH12D and DH12E) 6-cylinder 12-litre engine, coupled to a Volvo-automated, ZF automatic, or more recently, Volvo I-Shift transmission.
Volvo also developed a low-entry variant of B12B, known as the Volvo B12BLE, for intercity and city operations.
The Volvo B12B will be superseded by Volvo B13R with 13-litre engine.
