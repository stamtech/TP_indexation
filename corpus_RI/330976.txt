Johnson has long been one of Washington's most prominent leaders, holding leadership positions in business, the arts, and politics.  
Johnson began his career as a faculty member at Princeton University, later moving on to the United States Senate as a staff member and to the Dayton-Hudson Corporation (now Target Corp.) as director of public affairs.  He was executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale during the entire Carter Administration (1977   1981).  Later, he founded and headed Public Strategies, a private consulting firm, from 1981 to 1985 before leaving for Lehman Brothers.
From 1991 to 1998, he served as chairman and chief executive officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the quasi-public organization that guarantees mortgages for millions of American homeowners.  Previously, he was vice chairman of Fannie Mae (1990   1991) and a managing director with Lehman Brothers (1985   1990). An Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) report from September 2004 found that, during Johnson's tenure as CEO, Fannie Mae had improperly deferred $200 million in expenses. This enabled top executives, including Johnson and his successor, Franklin Raines, to receive substantial bonuses in 1998. A 2006 OFHEO report found that Fannie Mae had substantially under-reported Johnson's compensation. Originally reported as $6   7 million, Johnson actually received approximately $21 million.
As of 2006, he is a vice chairman of the private banking firm Perseus LLC, a position he has held since 2001.  He is also a board member at Goldman Sachs, Gannett Company, Inc., a media holding group, KB Home, a home construction firm, Target Corporation, Temple-Inland, and a former director of UnitedHealth Group.
Johnson has also served as chairman of both the Kennedy Center for the Arts (1996   2004) and the Brookings Institution (1994   2003).  He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Friends of Bilderberg, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. In 1994 he received the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for his contributions to the U.S.'s building heritage during his tenure at Fannie Mae.
On May 22, 2008, Democratic Party officials confidentially divulged that Obama had asked Johnson "to lead the process" for selecting Obama's running mate. On June 4, 2008, Obama announced the formation of a three-person committee to vet vice presidential candidates, including Johnson.  However, Johnson soon became a source of controversy when it was reported that he had received loans directly from Angelo Mozilo, the CEO of Countrywide Financial, a company implicated in the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.  Although he was not accused of any wrongdoing and was initially defended by Obama on the grounds that he was simply an unpaid volunteer, Johnson announced he would step down from the vice-presidential vetting position on June 11, 2008, in order to avoid being a distraction to Obama's campaign. 
Johnson is a strong Obama supporter who has personally donated the maximum $4,600 to his 2008 Presidential campaign, as well as $1,000 to Obama's Senate campaign in 2004. In addition to personal donations, Johnson is a bundler for the Obama campaign, raising between $200,000 and $500,000.  He has also participated in Obama campaign efforts to recruit former Clinton supporters.
On September 19, 2008, the McCain campaign released an ad critical of Obama which linked him to Johnson.
According to Gretchen Morgenson, who with Joshua Rosner wrote ''Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon'', James Johnson is the "corporate America's founding father of regulation manipulation" and one of the key figures responsible for the 2008 financial breakdown.
Johnson received a B.A. in political science from the University of Minnesota and a Master of Public Affairs degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. In 1997, Mr. Johnson received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Colby College, in 1999 he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Howard University, and in 2002, he received another Doctor of Laws from Skidmore College.
