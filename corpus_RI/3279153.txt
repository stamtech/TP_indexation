The Blue Line was the initial line to enter into service, operating between San Ysidro and Downtown San Diego.  The Orange Line began service in March 1986 linking eastern suburban areas also to Downtown San Diego.  The Green Line began service in July 2005 and included the system's first underground station located at San Diego State University.

Each route runs inbound to downtown San Diego or Kearny Mesa during the morning commute period and outbound in the afternoon commute period.  Over-the-road Greyhound style vehicles are used for these Commuter Express Services.
Five express fixed-route bus routes (Routes 20, 50, 150, 210, and 960) are operated along major roadways and highways and link intermediate distant suburban areas to the San Diego urban area.   Two of the five routes only operate during the morning and evening commute periods.  Vehicles used for service are typically standard 40-foot buses or 60-foot articulated buses.
Urban bus routes link the densely populated neighborhoods and adjacent cities together with direct and frequent bus service.  These services constitute the bulk of fixed-route bus services operated in terms of vehicle requirements and patronage.    Typically, headways are 12   15 minutes between scheduled bus arrival/departure times during commute periods and during midday times.  Generally, no worse than 30-minute headways occur during non-commute periods and weekends.  Local routes generally have stops placed every block or every other block.  Limited routes have stops placed every approximately quarter to half mile.  Major arterial roads in the City Heights and North Park area of San Diego have both types of routes available, providing for more frequent service.  Articulated buses are used during the summer on weekends on route 30 to provide extra access to the beaches.  Route 7 utilizes articulated buses along University Ave due to it being the busiest bus route in San Diego.
Local routes and Shuttle services are also operated by MTS.  These typically operate less frequently or have a shorter range.

Effective January 1, 2008, MTS raised fares and eliminated transfer passes for some fixed-route bus services.   The regular passenger fare for each boarding increased from $1.75 to $2.25 per boarding to a maximum $2.00 to $2.25 per boarding depending on the route.  The Monthly Pass increased from $60 to $64.
Although the cash fare increase was modest, $0.25, the elimination of free Transfer Passes was controversial.  This impacted infrequent cash fare paying riders using multiple bus routes to complete their trip the most because each boarding requires the full fare be paid.  As a response, MTS encouraged riders to purchase a $5 Daily Pass for access on the whole system as it is approximately the same cost as the total would be for a round trip utilizing a single bus for each direction and paying the single ride fare each time.  Or, to consider purchasing a $64 Monthly Pass.

While the adult Premium Monthly Pass (including travel on $5.00 premium express buses) remained at $90, new $45 youth and $22.50 senior/disabled/Medicare premium monthly passes were introduced.
Effective July 1, 2009, MTS eliminated the downtown zone fare category for the San Diego Trolley. As a result, the regular passenger fare for all one-way trips on the trolley became $2.50 regardless of origin or destination point; seniors, people with disabilities, and Medicare cardholders pay just $1.25 each. MTS also increased the passenger fare for shuttle bus routes to $2.25 ($1.10 senior/disabled/Medicare). All other single-ride cash fares remain unchanged. The cost of an ordinary 1-day pass also remained at $5, but the cost of a 1-day RegionPlus pass increased from $11 to $14. MTS also increased the prices of all monthly passes (e.g. from $68 to $72 for a regular 30-day adult pass) and began selling 14-day passes, which replace the half-month passes.
