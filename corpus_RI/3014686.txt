I believe that "Mr. Eddie Willers" suffers from the same problem as the previous selections: it is too close to existing accounts, and we must steer clear of possible misunderstandings due to username similarities.  Perhaps you could consider a more "radical" variation of your original selection, something that would be distinctive enough to prevent mistaken identity incidents in the future.

Okay, I'll use a new username: Wikipediaman123   19:28, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
Thanks. Can I delete my old userpage and talk page from the network permanently?
As another request contained - inactivity will be present with Sleepy and will just fade away.
I have been asked by Essjay to follow up on this request. ... How do I do this?
Current Name:  Rwesley007@msn.com
Requested Name:  Rwesley007
Reason:  I inappropriated used my email address as a username.
Can I have my username changed to "Danny Fenton" please? Invisble Robot Fish is kinda a long name. If not I would like it to be changed to "DannyFenton". And if even that is taken, I'll keep it Inivisible Robot Fish. Thank you. &nbsp;&mdash; ''      '' 23:01, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

Current name: Andreas08
Requested name: Mgb1719 
Reason:  I made an account with my name then, i decided not to use it because of my name, so i changed it and made edits but i was still loged in with my old account and not the one with less personal information. Thank You
Further Reasoning: Well i live in a small town(the one i edited on) and I am the only person with that name basically, and i wish that people did not know it was me. Thank You for your help
Thank You Very Much
Is this better?    Preceding   comment added by   (       )  (still under previous username)

Rather be Hysteria2424.
Confirming, this is a genuine post. Please change to Hysteria2424. Thanks.
Thank you.   18:34, 12 October 2006 (UTC)
I would still like my username changed. People searching for my site are directed here because of the username. Editing under an IP address doesn't solve that problem.
