People say one   s fate has been pre-determined from the start like the cards in a Texas Hold   em game. Uno (Lau Ching Wan), a small time crook turned Casino magnate, and Jack, the scion of a powerful gaming clan lead very different lives until fate brought them together in a poker duel of a lifetime... 
The setting is Macau, Las Vegas of the Orient, where the buzz in town is that Uno has snared the operations of the venerable Sun Casinos from its deceased owner. In a bid to clear his name, he has the sole heir Jack (Louis Koo) brought back from Canada where he spent the last few years in hiding. Jack, an inept businessman and a socially awkward young man, spent his days playing online poker. When it became clear that he has neither the instinct nor the skills to take over, Uno invokes the owner   s will and takes charge of Jack's family business. 
Disillusioned and depressed, Jack runs into Smiley (Stephy Tang), a simple girl with a seemingly unstoppable good fortune.  Together the pair conquers the poker rooms in Macau until Jack is summoned by Uno's arch rival Ms. Fong (Josie Ho) to represent her corporation in the ultimate Poker King tournament. As Jack issues a personal challenge to Uno, it becomes clear that it isn't only bragging rights at stake, but also the throne to the gambling empire that Jack   s father had built. In the end, there can only be one Poker King.
