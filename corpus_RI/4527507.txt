The '''Wright Liberator''' is a low-floor single-deck bus body built on Volvo B10L chassis by Wright.
Around 146 were built between 1996 and 1999. It was discontinued in favour of the Renown on Volvo B10BLE chassis, which in turn was superseded by the Eclipse on Volvo B7L chassis from 2001. 
The principal customer for the type was the National Express Group for its Travel West Midlands and Travel Dundee subsidiaries. The first 20 buses for Travel West Midlands (registered P401 to P420 EJW) were used for bus route "Line 33" (which has since been run by double-deck Volvo B7TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini buses), followed by another 60 buses (registered P421 EJW to R480 XDA).
A few were bought by GMPTE, however only lasted a few months with GM's livery as they were bought by FirstGroup.
