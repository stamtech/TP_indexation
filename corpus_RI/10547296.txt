Prior to Obama's election, the protagonist, a CIA agent named Theodore J. Higginbothem III, or "Higgy"  uncovers a vast conspiracy surrounding Barack Obama. After Obama is elected, the protagonist attempts suicide, but is unsuccessful; afterwards, he goes to work for the president. 
The book presents various conspiracy theories about President Obama and other Democrats as fact, including that:
Other scenes depicted in the book include Jeremiah Wright demanding "100,000 a year in reparations for every black man, woman, and child", Obama having his feet washed by a "Filipino steward" and his cigarette smoke fanned away by "barely dressed Thai boys", and Katie Couric having "erect nipples...clearly visible through her blouse" while "in full swoon over Barack Obama" because she wanted to "go out on a date with" him. 
Andrew Zarowny of the conservative website Right Pundits wrote a favorable review of the book, which he described as "hilarious". He also cited another review of the book written by advertising executive Jerry Della Femina.
