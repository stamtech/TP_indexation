The band was not satisfied with Leone and replaced him by former Unruled singer Cory Lowe after a few shows. They were not satisfied with Lowe either, so they fired him too and Dakin decided he would sing and play bass at the same time. The band released two albums and toured twice in the United States. Their first album, ''Dead Brain Cells'' was released in 1987. It was followed by a concept album, ''Universe'' in 1989.
The Dead Brain Cells song ''The Genesis Explosion'' was featured in a Canadian television commercial for Microcell Telecommunications in 2005.  The commercial depicts an older woman using her cell phone to win a radio call-in show.
The band's guitarist, Gerry Ouellette, died on November 12, 1994. The three surviving members of DBC continue to perform occasionally in Canada with Jason Quinn replacing Ouellette on Guitar and Graham Ferguson as part-time drummer.
