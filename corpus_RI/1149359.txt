Production of the Volvo SI6 began at Ford's Bridgend Engine plant in Wales in May 2006. It is likely that the engines will be used in European Ford and Jaguar products as well as Volvos.
The 3.0&nbsp;L turbocharged engine is available in a light-pressure turbo (LPT) version. Cylinder bore is 82.0&nbsp;mm (3.23&nbsp;in) and stroke is 93.2&nbsp;mm (3.67&nbsp;in) with a compression ratio of 9.3:1.
In 2010 for MY2011 a new upgraded version was unveiled with the new Volvo S60 giving higher output and lower fuel consumption to replace the old T6 in all cars.
