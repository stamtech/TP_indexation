The website officially launched in July 2006 with a web-based video recorder that merged a user's karaoke performance to create a contest entry.  The site received strong praise from industry experts including Walt Mossberg of the WSJ.  Within a few months the site opened up contests for audio karaoke, videos, photos and text.  In November 2006 the site switched to a faceoff style voting system, increasing votes from 5000 a day to 150,000 a day.  Site votes reached as much as 1,000,000 in a day in 2007.  Users voted 25 times per visit on average.
