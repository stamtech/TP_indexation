Although Celebrate Recovery meetings are similar to those of other twelve-step programs, one difference is in their focus on Christianity. The program stresses that there is no other Higher Power except for Jesus, as opposed to groups like Alcoholics Anonymous which encourage members to choose their own concept of a Higher Power. Another difference is that Celebrate Recovery does not require one to conform to a singleness of purpose declaration, a member does not have to qualify oneself as an alcoholic, addict, or gambler&mdash;there are no requirements for membership. You may attend with a desire to work the steps for healing with any number of "hurts, hang-ups or habits" (compulsive behaviors).
Celebrate Recovery teaches the Twelve Steps by relating them with Biblical verses.
Saddleback Senior Pastor Rick Warren devised a set of Principles based on the Beatitudes.
Some believe that other twelve-step programs that encourage members to choose their own Higher Power is a more effective way to bring about recovery.  Celebrate Recovery also receives many of the same criticisms of other twelve-step programs.
