Its 6.2&nbsp;km (3.9&nbsp;mi) berthing space can accommodate an aircraft carrier and is often used by visiting ships of the Royal Navy as part of the Five Powers Defence Arrangements and United States Navy (USN), as a result of the signing of the addendum to the 1990 United States-Singapore Memorandum of Understanding in 10 November 1990, which formalised arrangements for USN ships to use CNB facilities.
The Straits Times stated in an editorial that: 
Automation was incorporated into the design of CNB to reduce manpower requirements. It has an automated underground ammunition depot that allows ammunition to be loaded onto the ships and an automated warehouse system to store items. The base has a fibre optic broadband network for information management. The base was also designed to be environment-friendly, with three small-scale wind turbines powering the 50 lights along the breakwaters at night. Conventional roof construction materials were substituted by 72 thin film solar panels and the solar energy generated lights 100 downlights in the base. Seawater is used in the air-conditioning system, saving about 35,000&nbsp;m   (equivalent to 20 Olympic-sized pools) of potable water annually.
Currently, the submarines, frigates, amphibious transport docks and missile gunboats are based at CNB. Co-located in CNB is the Changi Naval Training Base, also known as RSS ''Panglima'' - named in honour of the first ship of the navy.
