Sinag performed exceptionally well from the beginning of the race in Darwin on Sunday, October 21. Needing only minor adjustments to its brake system, Sinag quickly zoomed to 11th place. The team  maintained this position and made excellent time, passing the halfway mark at Alice Springs on Wednesday, October 24, and breaching the 2,000km mark at Cadney Homestead the following day, October 25.
