The '''iLoo''' (short for '''internet loo''') was a cancelled Microsoft project to develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an adjustable plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular URLs. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next in a series of successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.
The project was announced by MSN UK on April 30, 2003, and was widely ridiculed before being declared a hoax by Microsoft on May 12. However, on May 13, another Microsoft press release stated that although the project had not been a hoax, it had been cancelled because it would do little to promote the MSN brand. There has since been speculation as to whether the project was cancelled for fear of being sued by Andrew Cubitt, who had invented the similarly named product "i-Loo". The iLoo was described as a public relations "debacle" by ''Online Journalism Review''.
 Externally, the facility would feature an MSN logo and have a "hotmail station" with an additional plasma screen and keyboard for waiting consumers. A security guard was to be stationed near the unit to ensure that it was being properly used and to prevent the unit from being stolen. The iLoo was to debut "at a majority of the summer season festivals". The iLoo was to be deployed only in Britain.
The project was announced on April 30, 2003 in press release by MSN UK, MSN's British subsidiary, as part of a "series of MSN.co.uk initiatives which look at the changing nature of how we use the web as it constantly evolves". The press release stated that:
The UK   s most popular website msn.co.uk is creating the world   s first    Internet Loo   . The iLoo will be mobile and is part of MSN   s mission to allow instant logging on    anytime and any place   .
In time for the summer festival season, MSN is in the process of converting a portable loo to create a unique experience for surfers looking for an alternative to the bog-standard festival loo experience. Users will be able to sit down, undock a wireless keyboard and conveniently access the first ever WWW.C.
The press release also stated that "MSN is also in talks with toilet paper manufacturers to produce special web paper for those in need of URL inspiration".
 The story became the most-emailed story on Yahoo! News on May 1, 2003, being emailed over 4000 times.This is based on http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index2&cid=964 now http://news.yahoo.com/most-popular which is a service provided by Yahoo! to track the most popular stories. The iLoo was widely derided and press coverage subjected MSN and Microsoft to heavy criticism. On May 10, ''The Inquirer'' published a story in which Andrew Cubitt alleged that "Microsoft stole his iLoo idea" from his i-Loo invention. On May 12, Microsoft announced that the iLoo was a "hoax perpetrated by its British division" calling it an "April Fool's joke" and issued an apology for the confusion. The Associated Press, however, stated that they had previously received confirmation of the project from two of Microsoft's PR firms: Waggener Edstrom Worldwide and Red Consultancy. The ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' also stated that it received confirmation from Waggener Edstrom and was even provided with a schematic drawing. Furthermore, April Fools was almost a month before, and Microsoft had never before released a fake press release.
 with the final decision made by MSN senior vice president David Cole. MSN product manager Lisa Gurry stating that the project "didn't really map to our global branding objectives". Microsoft again apologized for the miscommunication stating "the confusion over the legitimacy of this effort was caused by people moving too quickly and who misspoke before gathering all of the relevant information". Prior to the cancellation, an iLoo prototype was in the "early stages of construction". MSN allows regional units to design their own marketing campaigns, and the UK division had developed a reputation for innovative campaigns, in this case involving British toilet humour. The iLoo which was designed for the UK as part of a "tongue-in-cheek marketing initiative" was "intended to be the next in line of a number of clever initiatives in the UK involving introducing the internet in interesting locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair". The previous initiatives were well received. Microsoft stated that no employees were disciplined as a result of the debacle, although the company stated that it would conduct "internal discussions".
 Critics contended that the product was a waste of money and doomed to fail. Concerns were raised about how the iLoo would serve to extend waiting lines, how hygienic it would be to share keyboards in a public loo, and what would be happen if the keyboard was urinated upon. Critics also questioned whether users would spend enough time in the loo to make use of the internet facilities, noting that "most port-a-potty users stay only long enough to relieve themselves without having to inhale."|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/648422031.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT |date=June 14, 2003 |publisher=The Toronto Star |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}
 The ''Herald Sun'' wrote that the "iLoo is, unquestionably, very good news     mainly to journalists with a bottomless pit of laboured bum jokes" while the ''Seattle Times'' wrote "now the company has a credibility problem as well as a red face." Other newspapers issued humorous headlines: ''Microsoft technology headed for toilet'' from the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', ''Toilet mixes zeroes with ones and twos'' from the ''Washington Post'',|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2791231/Toilet-mixes-zeroes-with-ones.html|first=Tim |last=Lemke|date=May 7, 2003|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=2011-03-04}} and ''Microsoft's Gone Potty'' from ''The Daily Mirror''.{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Gone Potty |first=Amy |last=Vickers |date=May 2,  2003 |work=The Daily Mirror |location= London }}
 Microsoft's public relations response to the debacle is also considered to be one of the poorest in the company's history, given Microsoft's reputation for micro-managing news releases, interviews and promotional events.
The iLoo's negative publicity drowned out the launch of MSN Radio Plus on May 12, 2003. It has since inspired a number of spoofs.
Microsoft never formally commented on Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke. As a result, Cubitt questioned whether this was "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't even know what time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" Cubitt went on to state that "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I will never be able to produce the idea" and as such was "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements". Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.
The i-Loo was described as:
The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser is a novel and unique product designed to make best use of the time you spend on the loo!  The product allows you to search the internet whilst sitting on the toilet and print out any web pages you are interested in on your toilet paper. i-Loo brings a whole new meaning to the word downloading. The unit is fixed in front of a toilet on the cubical wall.  The product provides up to date information about new products, daily news and lottery results through an easy to navigate software package.  Normal operation of the toilet and paper dispenser is evident.
The i-Loo featured an internet-enabled monitor on the cubicle wall and a special printer that would allow users to print information on a standard toilet paper roll.
The i-Loo internet toilet roll browser was featured at the 2003 ''Daily Mail'' Ideal Home Show as part of the Future Concepts exhibition in Earls Court, London, where it was nominated for the MFI Bright Sparks 2003 awards. The i-Loo, which was sponsored by Epson Printers, received significant press coverage, and was featured on GMTV as well as various radio shows.
