One of the oldest maps still in existence depicting Cornwall is the 1290 Hereford Mappa Mundi currently on display in Hereford Cathedral in the United Kingdom. Many maps of the British Isles prior to the 17th century showed Cornwall (Cornubia / Cornwallia/ Kernow) as a nation on a par with Wales and examples include the maps of Sebastian Munster, Abraham Ortelius, and Girolamo Ruscelli. After the 17th century, maps of Cornwall tended to no longer make the distinction between Anglia and Cornubia, the British Sea was renamed the English Channel and Cornwall as a separate entity was omitted from the maps.
