The '''151st Cavalry Regiment''' is a United States Army cavalry regiment currently represented in the Arkansas Army National Guard by 1st Squadron, 151st Cavalry Regiment, headquartered in Warren, Arkansas, an element of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team.
The 151st Cavalry Regiment was originally represented in the Arkansas National Guard by Troop E, 151st Cavalry Regiment from 1967 until the 39th Brigade Combat Team converted to the Modular Brigade Combat Team concept in 2005.  At that time, Troop E, 151st CAV at Marianna, Arkansas was deactivated and the Regimental Headquarters was moved to Warren, Arkansas.  The former 3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment was deactivated and it's units were organized as the 1st Squadron, 151 Cavalry Regiment.
12 October 2003, 3-153rd IN and E/151st CAV activated for Operation Iraqi Freedom II and deployment as elements of the 39th Brigade (separate) with the 1st Cavalry Division to Iraq.  The 39th Brigade trained at Fort Hood, Texas and Fort Polk, LA before deploying to Iraq in March 2004.  Troop E, 151 CAV spent much of the deployment attached to 3-153 IN and was responsible for patrolling the city of Hussainiyah, a town of 500,000 about 12 miles north of Baghdad.  At other points in the deployment, E Troop was task organized to 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery.  E/151st Cavarly had one platoon of Troopers from Company C, 1st Battalion, 102nd Infantry, Connecticut National Guard with them for OIF II.
2005, 5 September- 1st Squadron of the 151st Cavalry Regiment is officially organized. Echo Troop, 151st Cavalry Regiment deactivated. Regimental Headquarters moved to Warren, Arkansas. The 1-151st was organized as a Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition Squadron
The IBCT Reconnaissance Squadron is composed of a Headquarters and Headquarters Troop (HHT), two motorized (mounted) recon troops, a dismounted recon troop, and a forward support troop. The HHT is organized like a typical HHC, with the Squadron command group and staff sections. The motorized recon troops consist of a troop headquarters and 3 scout platoons. The scout platoons consist of 6 HMMWVs, armed with .50 cal M2 machine guns, 40 mm Mk 19 grenade launchers, M41 TOW improved target acquisition system, M240B machine guns, and are equipped with the LRAS3 (Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System). Currently, the scout platoons are manned with 18 19D Cavalry Scouts, but recent revisions call for increasing the manning to 24 scouts.
Women are not eligible to serve in a RSTA unit, as RSTA soldiers are considered a combat unit on the front line of enemy engagement. In practice, however, this regulation only holds true for the 'line' troops (the mounted/dismounted recon troops). The Forward Support Troop, despite being part of the Squadron, is technically assigned to the Brigade Support Battalion, allowing female soldiers to serve in a RSTA Squadron in non-combat roles such as mechanics, and truck drivers.

Yellow is the traditional color used by Cavalry units. The horse symbolizes the proud heritage and tradition of Cavalry. The Chevron suggests the forward motion, underscoring the unit   s motto. The Polestar, adapted from the compass rose, highlights the leadership and direction while alluding to the North Star, commemorating the unit   s WW II service in the Aleutians. Black and white refers to night and day and "around the clock" military capabilities. 1-151 Cavalry proudly serves as the Infantry Brigade Commander   s eyes and ears on the combined arms battlefield
