Notes: NJ 183 and NJ 185 struck since they were moved up top. I also struck NJ 159 and NJ 181 since they have maps. NJ 168 is now B-Class; it will be moved up top. NJ 162 has a map but it is not MTF-compliant.     '''   ''' 09:29, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

I would like to request maps for the following four GA's, keeping in compliance with the five-requests-per-state limit:
If maps for New York State Route 242, NY 198, and Ridge Road (Western New York) could be made that would be great.

Hi can someone make a map of the Saginaw Trail, using the book ''A Drive Down Memory Lane: The Named State and Federal Highways of Michigan'', its on page 192. Including current state highways and interstates, as well as cities, would be very useful. Thanks.   ( ) 03:28, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

Thistle, Utah is under Wikiproject Ghost Towns, not USRD. However it very much is relevant to USRD, and a significant amount of the article's content is dedicated to US-6.  My goal is to get this to FA, it's currently asses to B class by Wikproject Ghost towns. Could I get a map of before and after the landslide locations of US6, US89 and the railroads? This would be similar to this one ? Thanks in advance, I know this is an unusual request.   ( ) 23:11, 15 March 2010 (UTC)

The map:   was created in 2005. It contains a disclaimer that it isn't "pin-accurate". Would someone be willing to create a new, replacement map off GIS data for the state of Michigan? Create it with MTF standards and colors using more current GIS data so we can retire that five-year-old map from the article. ''' &nbsp; &nbsp; '''  19:59, 8 July 2010 (UTC)

Its not an error per say, but I know last time I was editing a lot, GAN took issue to maps like this one, as none of the lines are labeled, and even being from Washington, I have no clue where that little segment you see is on the map. If someone can update / redo the map like Utah State Route 103's that would be appreciated. --  ( ) 17:42, 24 October 2010 (UTC)
In the   for US 113, the map in the infobox,  , was noted as lacking a key and GIS source.  I would appreciate someone updating the map with those features.  Any other updates to spruce up the map would be greatly appreciated as well. &mdash;   ( ) 02:12, 1 November 2010 (UTC)
I just want a new map that's up to MTF standards (something like SR-103's map with an inset map, but without shields). Also, could the red line be comparatively thicker than the rest of the lines (as in )?   (      )     17:41, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

The current map has been nominated for deletion at Commons. Since US 66 is one of the project's few Top-importance articles (and rightfully so) I figured I'd post here in case someone wants to make a replacement before the old one's trashed. Even though US 66 is assessed as B-Class, I posted the request here because, well, it shouldn't be B-Class in the sad condition it's in.     '''   ''' 17:15, 29 November 2010 (UTC)
