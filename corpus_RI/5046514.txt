WLWI-FM broadcasts a country music format to the Montgomery metropolitan area.  The station has a sister news/talk AM station known as WLWI (AM).
Notable on-air personalities associated with the station include Andi Scott, Bill Dollar, Dr. Sam, Jimmy Carter, WSFA 12 Chief Meteorologist Rich Thomas, Bill Roberts, and Miles Long.  Syndicated programming includes ''After Midnite with Blair Garner'' hosted by Blair Garner from Premiere Radio Networks. On July 14, 2010, WLWI-FM added the syndicated ''Rick and Bubba'' morning show, formerly on sister station WHHY-FM.
This station first began broadcasting on July 15, 1969, as '''WCOV-FM''', the FM partner to AM station WCOV (now WACV). The station was acquired by Griffin Broadcasting Corporation in April 1973 and the callsign was changed to '''WKLH'''. This callsign would also prove short-lived as the station was acquired by the Colonial Broadcasting Company in December 1977 and the call letters were changed to '''WLWI'''.
The company changed the call letters of newly-acquired AM station WBAM (now WMSP) to "WLWI" on March 11, 1985, so the FM station was assigned the current '''WLWI-FM''' call letters by the FCC on the same day.
In September 1994, Colonial Company, Inc., the holding company that owned WLWI-FM licensee Colonial Broadcasting Company, Inc., reached an agreement to sell control of the licensee corporation to Robert E. Lowder.  The deal was approved by the FCC on December 8, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on March 8, 1995. 
In January 1998, Robert E. Lowder agreed to sell licensee Colonial Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Cumulus Holdings, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on March 10, 1998.  In December 1998, the license for WLWI-FM was transferred to Cumulus Licensing Corp.  The deal was approved by the FCC on December 12, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on December 31, 1998.
In 1984, WLWI-FM was named "Radio Station of the Year (Small Market)" by the Academy of Country Music.
A long-time country music formatted station, WLWI-FM has seen its on-air personalities nominated for Country Music Association Awards as Medium Market or Small Market Broadcast Personality of the Year many times over the years.  Sam Faulk was nominated in 1981 and won the award in 1989. Warren "Rhubarb" Jones won in 1983.  Darlene Dixon was nominated in 1992 and 1999. John Boy was nominated in 1995.
In 2004, WLWI host Bill Roberts was named Favorite Southern Gospel DJ for a Medium Market at the Singing News Fan Awards.
