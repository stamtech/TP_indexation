The '''Brea Mall''' is a shopping mall located in the Orange County city of Brea, California. Brea was originally an oil town and is within minutes of California State University, Fullerton. Since 1998 the mall has been owned and operated by the Simon Property Group. It is home to four major department stores, over 175 specialty shops and boutiques, and a food court. It is approximately 1,310,000 square feet (1.31 million). Though the Brea Mall is a high quality and somewhat upscale shopping mall, it is overshadowed by its Orange County shopping center rivals, The South Coast Plaza (Costa Mesa, CA) and Fashion Island (Newport Beach, CA). While the Brea Mall does have a Nordstrom store, it lacks an ultra high end anchor such as Neiman Marcus. Despite the mall managements best efforts, and while Brea, nearby Yorba Linda, and the northern end of Fullerton are generally considered affluent, they are not on par with the likes of Newport Beach and as such the Brea Mall does not warrant an ultra high end anchor.
The Brea Mall is generally considered to be among the premier shopping destinations in North Orange County and owes much of its success to its strategic location near the 57 freeway.
The Brea Mall has also been host to recording artists such as Ashlee Simpson, Mya, Ryan Cabrera, and The Summer Obsession.
The mall was featured in the Jeffries Fan Club song: "JFC Where Did You Go". The lyrics are "Visit Chris Rush at the Brea Mall," Chris Rush being their trumpet player.
Some conspiracy theories say that JFK's assassin worked Tuesdays at the mall clearing tables. At the entrance to the mall there is a small plaque commemorating this fact.
