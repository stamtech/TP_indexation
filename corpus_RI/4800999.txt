In Hungary the standard lengths for area codes is two, except for Budapest (the capital), which has the area code '''1'''.  Subscribers' numbers are six digits long in general, numbers in Budapest and cell phone numbers are seven digits long.
Calls within local areas can be made by dialling the number without the area code, such as '''123-4567''' in Budapest or '''123-456''' in other areas. However, this is not permitted in mobile phone networks.
Domestic calls to all other area codes must be preceded with '''06''' + '''area code'''. For example, a call from Budapest to Monor (area code 29) would be made as '''06 29 123-456''' and a call from Monor to Budapest (area code 1) would be made as '''06 1 234-5678'''. When using mobile phones, the international format can be used instead: '''+36 1 234-5678'''.
Calls to international destinations are in the format '''00''' + '''country code''' + '''number'''. On mobile phones, '''+''' can be used instead of '''00'''.
The country code for Hungary is  36.
Certain services can be called with a short number, ignoring the above scheme.
In ascending numeric order
Note: After April 1, 2004, the phone numbers can be carried from network to network. That means any of the previous codes can refer to any mobile provider.
