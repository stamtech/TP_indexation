He has written nine produced plays, including ''Another Country'', which won the SWET (now Olivier) Award for best play of the year (1981), and ''After Aida'' (1985), a play-with-music about composer Giuseppe Verdi.  He has also written the screenplay for five movies, starting by co-writing ''Arabesque'' (1966), and including the 1984 film adaptation of ''Another Country'', ''Wilde'', and ''Vincent & Theo''.
Mitchell was educated at Winchester College where he won the English Verse and Duncan Reading Prizes. He then did his national service in submarines 1953-55, (Sub Lt RNVR). He then went to Oxford, where he received a BA with first class honours in 1958.  This was followed by a period as a Harkness Fellow in the USA (1959   61). Since 1962 has been a freelance writer.
In the late 1960s, Mitchell co-wrote the teleplay ''Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)'' with Ray Davies of The Kinks. It was never produced, though it gave rise to the band's concept album. He recently recalled the aborted project: "''Arthur'' had a most unhappy history. It was originally meant to be a ... sort of rock opera, and we got as far as casting (excellent director and actors) and finding locations and were about to go when the producer went to a production meeting without a proper budget, tried to flannel his way through it, was immediately sussed and the production pulled. I have never been able to forgive the man."
In 2007 he wrote for BBC4 the drama ''Consenting Adults'' about Sir John Wolfenden and his celebrated 1957 report.
