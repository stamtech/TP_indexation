The '''Volvo S40''' is a small family car produced by Volvo.  It introduced the first generation '''S40''' ('''S'''aloon) and '''V40''' ('''V'''ersatility/estate) cars in 1995. The second generation arrived in 2004, and the wagon's name changed to '''V50'''.

British designer Peter Horbury, Volvo   s Design Director,
In 2001 Volvo updated the 40 Series ("Phase II"), implementing a number of technical improvements, e.g., improved engine management, direct (diesel) fuel injection, extra safety features, larger brake discs, new front suspension and steering, revised rear suspension, larger tires and a widening of the track width. A minor facelift gave larger headlights, more streamlining and larger rear light clusters as well as minor instruments and fascia re-design.
The 40 Series cars were equipped with four-cylinder engines, such as a 1.9 turbo diesel or 1.6 (1588 cc), 1.8 (1731 cc), 2.0T (1948 cc), 1.9 T4 (1855 cc) or 2.0 (1948 cc) fuel-injected gasoline engines all of which are derivatives of the modular whiteblock engine series that started life in the Volvo 960 and carried in both 5 and 6 cyl formats in Volvo's bigger FWD cars. There was also a 1.8&nbsp;L (1834 cc) Gasoline direct injection engine provided by Mitsubishi as part of the platform sharing between the 40 series and the Carisma.
The low (2.0T) and high (1.9 T4) pressure turbo variants at the top of the motor range. The 2.0T was rounded down and badged as 1.9T and was the only engine available in North America. The 5 speed manual transmission, widely available in Europe was not certified in US-spec S40s, with the 5 Speed automatic as the only option. No electric CVT transmission was planned unlike the 440 HTA / High Tech Auto CVT that had been released before the 400 series was completely phased out.
In the UK trim levels were XS, SE and CD.
A racing version (S40) was introduced in the British Touring Cars in 1997 and in 1998 the car, with Richard Rydell, took the championship.
Due to the common platform, many components of the suspension and drive train are compatible with Carisma as well as the Mitsubishi Evolution III. and Proton Impian.
The Volvo S40 was the first car to earn four stars in Euro-NCAP.

Introduced in the middle of the 2004 model year, the second generation S40 (known as the '''2004.5 Volvo S40''') introduced a new design based on the Volvo P1 platform built at the '''Volvo Cars''' factory in Ghent, Belgium. At the same time, the V40 was replaced by the V50 estate, also based on the P1 platform and built in Ghent.  The S40 was nominated for the ''World Car of the Year'' award for 2005 and won the Canadian Car of the Year ''Best New Sport Compact'' award for 2005.  It has also been elected the South African Car of the Year for 2005 by the South African Guild of Motoring Journalists.
The chassis for this car and the majority of its components were developed by Volvo, however similar mechanical components can be found in the Mazda3 and the European Ford Focus.  The engine, a 2.5L 5 cylinder (B5254T3, and B5254S respectively for the turbo and naturally aspirated models) is the latest generation of Volvo's 5 cylinder engines.  These inline fives have been continually developed by Volvo since the debut of the engine in the 850, in 1993. The top of the line S40 T5 AWD, as well as the 2.4 and 2.4i, powertrain is still made by Volvo.  The transmission is developed with Getrag at Volvo's Koping Transmission Center in Sweden, and the AWD system bought from Haldex Traction of Sweden.
The S40 T5 (one of the several variants of the S40) features a 2.5&nbsp;L (2521&nbsp;cc) five-cylinder fuel-injected engine with a light-pressure turbocharger. The valvetrain has four valves per cylinder and is a DOHC design. The engine is transversely mounted at the front of the vehicle and drives the front wheels, as was with the first generation.
A new range of engines and transmissions has been introduced at the end of May 2010 (see "Engine specifications" below). In North America, however, the normally-aspirated 5-cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, and manual transmission were all dropped for the 2011 model year, leaving only the automatic, front-wheel drive T5 in base and R-Design trims.
In early 2004, Volvo started an ad campaign called ''The Mystery of Dalaro'' in which 32 residents of the same Swedish town bought the same car on the same day from the same dealer. The advert was produced in a documentary style by director Spike Jonze.
The S40 was refreshed for 2008. Improvements include improved audio systems, increased storage space and new safety features like Emergency Brake Lights which flash rapidly during hard braking to alert traffic behind the car. The new S40 also comes with optional Active Bi-Xenon headlights which point the light beam in the direction of the road as it curves (standard in SE Lux models). There is also a camera which can be located on the side mirrors which alerts the driver of passing vehicles beside the car. The camera is optional on all models. This is given the name BLIS (Blind Spot Information System).
Volvo released the 2.0 litre diesel Geartronic on the third week of February 2008 except in Ireland where it was released in the last week of May (due to delivery intervals).
The T5 engine received a performance increase of , giving an output of . The D5 engine became available with a manual gearbox offering  of torque and an automatic transmission offering  in the second half of 2007.
The 2009 model saw rear-end trunk lid changes, changing the badge from "VOLVO" to "V   O   L   V   O" with spaces between the letters with larger characters, as in the newer Volvo models.
From the end of May 2010, a new range of engines is available for the so-called "2011 model".
