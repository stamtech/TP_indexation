The '''BYD F3DM''' is a plug-in hybrid compact sedan manufactured by BYD Auto with an all-electric range of  and a hybrid electric powertrain that can extend the range an additional . The F3DM is the world's first mass produced plug-in hybrid automobile and went on sale to government agencies and corporations in the China on December 15, 2008.Crippen, A. (December 15, 2008)  ''CNBC''. Retrieved December 2008.Balfour, F. (December 15, 2008)  ''Business Week''. Retrieved December 2008. During its first year in the market the F3DM plug-in only sold 48 vehicles. Sales to the general public began in Shenzhen in March 2010, and only 417 units were sold during 2010.
A testing program was launched in the U.S. on December 2010 with the participation of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA). The F3DM is expected to go on sale in the U.S. in 2012 at a price of  before any government incentives.
The F3DM was introduced at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, preceded by the F6DM concept car which was first unveiled in the North American International Auto Show in January 2008.
BYD Auto uses a 16 kWh lithium iron phosphate batteries (LiFePO4) for the F3DM. BYD has said their LiFePO4 batteries are "inherently safe" because they are more chemically stable, although they pack less energy in each cell (100 Wh/kg), compared with more conventional lithium-ion (LiCoO2) batteries (150 to 200 Wh/kg).  The F3DM battery pack consist of 100 3.3-volt cells stored under the cabin.
BYD says the car will have a  all-electric range as well as a gasoline engine that allows operation in hybrid mode that extend the range for an additional . The electric range assumes the car is traveling at a constant speed of 50&nbsp;km/h, which is not likely to reflect real-world usage. The F3DM has a roof-mounted large solar panel capable of  providing electric energy to run vehicle accessories such us the radio and climate control.
The F3DM has two alternating current electric motors, a 50-kilowatt unit that drives the wheels and a 25-kilowatt helper that can send power to the wheels or generate electricity through regenerative braking. The two motors provide all the propulsion until the charge level of the F3DM   s batteries reaches 20%, then after this threshold the car automatically switches from electric mode operation to hybrid mode. At that point, the F3DM   s 1-liter 3-cylinder engine kicks in to bring the battery charge as close as possible to 30%, effectively extending the range of the vehicle just like the Chevrolet Volt does. The F3DM has a direct connection between the gasoline engine and the wheels that is useful when accelerating onto a highway, just like the Prius. Under high-load circumstances, the 68 horsepower gasoline engine combines with the electric motors to deliver a total of 168 horsepower.
BYD calls the F3DM is a dual-mode vehicle because it allows the driver to manually switch from all-electric to plug-in hybrid operation. The hybrid powertrain uses a 1.0-liter engine with battery-assisted acceleration at low speeds and the gasoline engine clutches to drive the wheels when more power is required. The estimated fuel economy is .
On December 15, 2008, the F3DM began selling for 149,800 yuan (about USD 21,900). In April 2009, the CEO Wang Chuanfu announced the price will be lowered to increase sales, but currently the price of a 2010 F3DM (with solar panels) is up to 169,800 yuan (US$25,792). Wang also wants an independent verification of the car's on-road performance.
 The premium price of the plug-in and lack of government subsidies are the main reasons cited by BYD for slow sales; others mention poor quality and "crude transitions" between electric and gasoline power. During 2009 BYD Auto sold 290,963 of the gasoline-powered F3s, which starts at 59,800 yuan (~US$8,750, just over a third of the price of an F3DM) and was China   s best-selling model.
Since March 29, 2010, BYD Auto began selling the F3DM to the general public in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, but only 28 units were sold during the first three months and all were sold to the Shenzhen local government. Among the reasons cited for the slow sales are the lack of infrastructure to charge, the high battery cost, and also the batteries have been reported to be unreliable.
As the F3DM nearly doubles the price of cars that run on conventional fuel, BYD expects subsidies from the local government to make the plug-in affordable to personal buyers. Similar subsidies are expected in other cities. On June 1, 2010, the Chinese government announced a trial program to provide incentives to carmakers up to 50,000 yuan (~US$7,320) for plug-in hybrids that will benefit residents in five cities: Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Hefei and Changchun. After the plug-in subsidy is discounted from the F3DM cost, its sales price would be still almost US$5,900 higher than the gasoline-powered F3 model.
As of November 2010, BYD reported that almost 300 F3DMs have been sold, with 117 units being sold in September 2010. 417 units were delivered in 2010, with BYD (a major battery manufacturer) claiming that they could not build enough batteries to meet demand. Some claim that the F3DM (and all-electric e6) are mere vaporware, designed to increase BYD's stock value.
In April 2011 BYD reported that the HACLA fleet achieved an average of  equivalent (MPG-e) based on a total of  accumulated by the fleet, of which ~ were traveled in all-electric mode, representing 72.3 percent of the total mileage logged by the HACLA fleet, and only  using gasoline.
The F3DM is schedule to begin retail sales in the U.S. in 2012 at a price of  before any federal and local incentives.
