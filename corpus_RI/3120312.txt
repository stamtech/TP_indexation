State Route 757 begins on Muller Lane at is junction with Foothill Road (State Route 206) on the west side of the Carson Valley just south of Genoa. From there, the highway heads due east along Muller Lane, passing through farmlands and open fields. The route crosses over the west and east forks of the Carson River on its trek. After about , the route comes to an end at U.S. Route 395 just north of Minden.
SR 757 originally carried the designation of a the longer State Route 19. That route, designated by 1929, connected a branch of State Route 3 (now U.S. Route 50) near South Lake Tahoe to California southeast of Gardnerville. The 1941 edition of Nevada's state highway map is the earliest to show this portion of the highway in its present alignment. The route was paved by 1948.
Nevada started renumbering its state highwayson July 1, 1976. At that time, the Muller Lane portion of SR 19 was reassigned to State Route 757. The new number was not shown on the official state map right away; the 1978&ndash;1979 edition of the state's tourist map continued to show SR 57 unchanged. The road was still shown on state maps without a route number in 1982. SR 757 was finally shown as a numbered highway on the 1991&ndash;1992 edition of the official state map map.
