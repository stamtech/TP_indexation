Thomas Mitchell was born in Dumfries but moved south of the border ''c.''1867.
Mitchell became secretary-manager of Blackburn Rovers in 1884. The club then went on to five FA Cup wins in eight seasons between 1884 and 1891. The final win in 1891 was against the Notts County side featuring David Calderhead. It does not appear documented if Mitchell was on board for the first of the FA Cup finals. Even with 4 FA Cups, he remains the most successful major trophy winner in the history of Blackburn Rovers.
Mitchell left Blackburn after 12 years as manager in 1896.
 other historical sources claim Hollis was only the club's trainer
Regardless of whether Hollis was properly in charge of the club during his time there, Mitchell is nevertheless credited as being Arsenal's first ''professional'' manager. However, he only lasted less than a season in the job, and although the club would reach fifth in the Second Division in 1897-98, neither he nor most of his signings stayed long with the club. Mitchell resigned as Arsenal manager on 10 March 1898.
Mitchell returned to Blackburn Rovers. He died in Blackburn in 1921, aged 78.
