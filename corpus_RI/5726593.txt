In this episode, Detectives Goren and Eames investigate the murder of a female restaurant critic found beaten to death.
During the investigation, they turn their suspicion to the chef at the last restaurant she visited, but unfortunately, he has also gone missing. Then they turn their attention to his wife and her father, a well-known chef whose cuisine the victim was about to criticize in a scathing review. Nevertheless, the discovery of a taped message soon deflects the team's investigation in another direction. As Goren begins to stitch together the pieces, he discovers a dark family secret that could be the final puzzle piece to solving the case.
