There is major environmental concern regarding conventional refrigeration technologies including contribution to ozone layer depletion  and global warming. Refrigerators which contain ozone depleting and global warming substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC   s), in their insulation foam or their refrigerant cycle are the most harmful. After CFC   s were banned in the 1980   s they were replaced with substances such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are ozone depleting substances and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  Both are environmentally destructive as potential global warming chemicals. If a conventional refrigerator is inefficient or use inefficiently, it will also contribute more to global warming than a highly efficient refrigerator. The use of solar energy to power refrigeration strives to minimize the negative impacts refrigerators have on the environment.
Traditionally solar-powered refrigerators and vaccine coolers use a combination of solar panels  and lead batteries to store energy for cloudy days and at night in the absence of sunlight to keep their contents cool.  These fridges are expensive and require heavy lead-acid batteries which tend to deteriorate, especially in hot climates, or are misused for other purposes.
A Portable solar powered fridge has been produced for use in the developing world.  The basic design uses the principle of evaporation.
The refrigerator employs a combination of heat conduction and convection, requires no electricity and can be made for commonly available material such as cardboard, sand and recycled metal.
The portable solar fridge is used in areas of Africa such as Zambia, Namibia, and South Africa in areas where electricity is often not readily accessible to help preserve perishable foods such as meat and dairy, however, is not yet being used for vaccines.
