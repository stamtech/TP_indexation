I don't watch poker on television and barely know how to play the game.  Just thought I'd get that out there first off.  So, while walking through my employer's break room just now, I saw a bit of a poker tournament on the TV.  One of the players had headphones on.  Are these checked by the holders of the tournament to confirm that the player isn't receiving signals from someone in the audience?  I would think that they'd have to be but I could be wrong...

There's a PSA I remember as a child shot in black and white depicting a black inter-city youth running thru the streets of the slums wearing a backpack.  His voice over is along the lines of "They say to don't do drugs, but life's hard on the streets".  It ends with an adult voice saying "For so-and-so...we're here for you" or something along those lines.  It was sponsored by the "Partnership for a Drug-Fee America" and ran in the early to mid 90's.  Can anybody remember the name of the PSA?

Is it just me, or do all the actors/actresses in these early American films seem to have an accent? Did people speak so differently back then (and I don't mean expressions or phrases, just the accents)?      Ker  uno  copia     21:22, 18 August 2010 (UTC)
