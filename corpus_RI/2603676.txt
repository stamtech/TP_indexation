The '''Wright StreetCar''' is an articulated bus developed by Wrightbus and Volvo Buses for FirstGroup.  It consists of an adapted Volvo B7LA (to be replaced by Volvo B9LA) chassis, featuring a separate driver compartment at the front, resembling to some extent similar designs in continental Europe. 
They feature air-conditioning and a wrap-around seating arrangement at the rear. They're designed to mimic trams in their appearance and in the UK, the Wright StreetCar buses are used on First Group's ftr services since its launch in May 2006, with high frequencies and dedicated stops to further enforce the impression of a premium service. They have also gained the nickname of "understeer streetcar" with some drivers, owing to a tendency to understeer negotiating roundabouts.
In 2006, Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada in the United States placed an order for 50 StreetCar Rapid Transit Vehicles for delivery in late 2000s. Developed from the Wright StreetCar, these will be hybrid-powered vehicles with chassis built by Carrosserie Hess of Switzerland. On December 24, 2008, RTC StreetCar A016 arrived on property appropriately on Christmas Eve.
In 2007, North East England bus operator Go North East ran a StreetCar trial on its popular X66 CentreLink service (currently operated by Wright Solar Fusions) between Gateshead Interchange and MetroCentre. The StreetCar was loaned from First Group.
