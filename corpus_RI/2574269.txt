The '''Volvo B10BLE''' is a low-entry city bus chassis which was popular in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and Australia. It was launched around 1992 with the engine mounted on the rear overhang of the bus. It was the successor of the citybus version of Volvo B10B and is used as a base for single-deck buses worldwide. The B10BLE is available in diesel-powered format, and later, also in a compressed natural gas-powered format with the fuel tanks on the roof of the bus.
Its low-floor design was widely promoted by Volvo when it was first launched, on the basis of added convenience to the passengers, and the increase in transport efficiency due to the low-floor design. This bus was succeeded by the Volvo B7L, Volvo B7RLE, Volvo B12B and Volvo B12BLE.
The Volvo B10BLE features a Volvo DH10A engine with a displacement of 9,600cc. It is an inline four-stroke six-cylinder diesel engine with a turbocharger and intercooler. The engine has a power output of either 245&nbsp;bhp (180&nbsp;kW) or 285&nbsp;bhp (210&nbsp;kW). The engine is able to meet Euro 2 emissions limits.
Optionally available is a Volvo GH10-series (GH10A, GH10B, GH10C) natural gas or biogas engine. All generations of this engine are inline four-stroke six-cylinder spark-ignition engines with a turbocharger and intercooler. The GH10A and GH10B engines were lean-burn engines and the GH10C is a "mixed-lean" engine, operating on an optimised balance between stoichiometric and lean-burn combustion strategies. Power ratings vary from 245&nbsp;bhp (180&nbsp;kW) in the GH10A to 290&nbsp;bhp (213&nbsp;kW) in the uprated version of the GH10C. The GH10C is able to meet Euro 4 emissions limits.
In mainland Europe, B10BLEs were bodied by Saffle and Aabenraa.
In Australia, the B10BLE is usually bodied by companies like Ansair, Phoenix Bus, Volgren and Custom Coaches.
In the United Kingdom, many of the B10BLEs had Wright Renown bodywork, and a small number were fitted with Alexander ALX300 bodywork.
