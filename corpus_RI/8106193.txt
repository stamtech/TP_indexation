To better reflect its expanding geographic service area, Riverside County's Credit Union adopted a new name and brand identity, Altura Credit Union, on October 1, 2004. Publicity for the name change said "Our new name means height, elevation, altitude."
Pronounced "all-TOUR-ah," the name is accompanied by new design elements and a new brand identity.  The colors reflect the water, agriculture and mountains of the Southern California communities served by Altura Credit Union.  The multiple colors and shapes are also meant to communicate Altura's commitment to diversity both within its organization and the community at large, as well as the range of services it offers.

As with all credit unions, membership in Altura is limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. Membership in Altura is open to anyone who lives, works, attends school or worships in Riverside and San Diego counties, plus the residents of selected cities in Orange County  and San Bernardino County .

In the late 1950s, Peggy Green, a secretary at Riverside Middle School, decided that classified school employees needed a credit union of their own.  Her husband was a teacher, and belonged to a teacher   s credit union, but only certificated employees could join     membership was not available if you were classified.  In October, 1956, she invited other school secretaries to a meeting to organize a credit union for classified personnel within the Riverside Unified School District.
On August 22, 1957 they were granted a state charter, listing the following six organizers:  Ethel C. Collier, Louise Bailey, Ruth C. Klock, Frank W. Meyer, George W. Peters, and Charles Sandell.  Ethell Collier handled the business from her desk at the RUSD payroll office.  The credit union soon moved to a portable building at Palm School, and then to its own office on Brockton Avenue.  On March 1, 1973, it moved to its present location on Riverside Avenue, which was remodeled in 1978 and again in 1990.
