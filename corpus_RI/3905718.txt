A map of SH 151 in Texas would be appreciated, it's a short freeway entirely within the San Antonio city limits.  Thanks. --  16:20, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
All right.  After many attempts and such, I have uploaded a new image for SH 151 with shields, and have made it an SVG.  Be forewarned that it still crashes Firefox when viewed at full size.  I really don't know whether its Firefox or ArcGIS that's causing the problem.    07:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC) 
New article; a map would be fantastic.  The routing mentioned in the article should be sufficient for making a map at the proper scale (i.e., the complicated routing through Erie, Buffalo, and Ogdensburg can probably be safely ignored), but if not, the provided links should give the necessary detail.      15:39, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
Short 3di in central Indiana. Heck, I don't think there are any other major roads along its length. &mdash;  ( ) 23:18, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
Short southern loop of Interstate 74 around Peoria, Illinois. SVG preferred. Thanks in advance! &mdash;  ( ) 22:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
Requested on my talk page. --    -   20:37, 16 November 2006 (UTC)
Southwest segment of loop around Quad Cities. I-80 is NE segment. I-74 runs straight through. After some thought, no shields on this one. Thanks! &mdash;  ( ) 13:26, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
This strictly doesn't relate to roads (though it does have a lot of roads in it, thus why I brought it here), but   badly needs to be replaced: it shows an Interstate 202!       07:27, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

America's longest 3 digit interstate should have a map. It is even longer than some two digit interstates. I would really appriciate if someone made a map for I-476. .--  16:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
I've been working on the Interstate 476 article to hopefully get it up to good article status, and I'd like to second the map request, it's a long, major route through eastern PA and could definitely benefit from a map illustrating the route. No shields and SVG would be nice, as per the map at Interstate 76.   03:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

I fixed up this article and a map would make the article perfect. This is a very important road that connects Philadelphia and The Poconos so i would really appriciated if a map was created for this road. --   13:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

Eisenhower Expressway in Chicago, very high volume. No shields, SVG, etc. etc. &mdash;  ( ) 18:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
This is a good map, it just doesn't the follow the recently established standards. If it can be reassigned colors, it would be an ideal map (and what I'm looking for when I request all the 3di maps, especially the overview map). &mdash;  ( ) 03:00, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
The article recently had   added.  This map is accurate and should be used as a basis, but is non-standard and low quality.     06:38, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
It would be nice to have a map of the Schuylkill Expressway to add to the article. No shields would be nice, to keep it consistent with the maps of Interstate 76 and Interstate 476.   ( / ) 21:06, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi Maps Task Force, thanks for all you do. Would it be possible to get a map for Utah State Route 150 (AKA Mirror Lake Highway)? The road runs through the western part of the Uinta Mountains of Utah.

Note that I'll be using a copy of this map in the history section with some annotations, because pictures are better than words. And because there are easier ways to say, "Well, this road was US 67A, then it became Illinois 267, then it became U.S. 67, then it became Illinois 267 again...". &mdash;  ( ) 19:09, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
