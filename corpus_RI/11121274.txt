Sean Michaels, co-founder of FundingFactory, received a phone call from a school official in Alton, Missouri, which was the spark of what is now a program which has awarded more than $20 million to schools and non-profits nation-wide. It started as the Educational Technology Conservation Exchange Program (ETCEP) in 1997 because a school official was looking to raise money to purchase for computers for his school by recycling printer cartridges, has blossomed into FundingFactory and the concept of fundraising by recycling.
Sean Michaels helped create a program for schools and other nonprofit organizations to raise the money that these types of entities are in need of by collecting used printer cartridges, a concept that didn   t exist before introduced by FundingFactory. Sean   s idea for recycling printer cartridges and recycling electronics was developed with a website so the entire fundraising program can be managed online.
By 1998, FundingFactory had its first client, the school back in Alton, Missouri, whose school official   s phone call launched the entire program in the first place.
To date, the FundingFactory recycling program has assisted over 50,000 nonprofits to raise more than $20 million.
ERS is the parent company of FundingFactory. The ERS and FundingFactory philosophy is logical and simple, to help nonprofits and to help the environment. Now and forever. 
Some of the organizations include schools, churches, libraries, day care centers, universities, scout troops, churches and other types of nonprofit organizations. FundingFactory programs divert cell phones and printer cartridges from ending up in landfills, helping to preserve the environment for tomorrow and beyond   making it a better place to live, work and play.
FundingFactory is completely free to anyone who joins. An organization that registers for an account at the FundingFactory website receives a registration kit with promotional and informational materials to help implement the fundraiser. 
Electronic items such as laserjet cartridges, inkjet cartridges, and cell phones are then collected by the organization.
Finally the collected items are sent into FundingFactory via a postage paid box. Points are awarded to the organization depending on the value of each item on the qualifying list. 
Points are redeemable for a check or in exchange for items in a rewards catalog.
