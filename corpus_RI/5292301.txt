Arriva North West as an operating division (distinct from the registered company ''Arriva North West Ltd'') came into being in its present form in January 2009, when Arriva Buses Wales was separated out from Arriva North West and Wales, although it had existed as an operating division between 1997 and 2002.
Arriva North West has a fleet of buses numbering just under 1,000.
In January 2009 the Wales operation was split from Arriva North West as Arriva Buses Wales.
The company has depots in:
Some Arriva services in Cheshire are run by Arriva Buses Wales.
The fleet consists of approximately 978 operational vehicles as at December 2010 , consisting of a wide variety of makes and types. The fleet is about 80% single-deck and 86% low-floor. Arriva stated its intention to make its main routes serving Liverpool completely low-floor by 2008, and the whole of Merseyside by 2011.
The Dennis Dart SLF, along with its smaller variant the MPD, still makes up a significant part of the fleet, accounting for just over 200 vehicles. The last step-entrance Dennis Darts have been withdrawn. More recently, the VDL SB120 and SB200 have become the standard single deck types, the majority featuring Wright Cadet, Commander and Pulsar bodywork; between them, these types now make up over a third of the fleet. Other new deliveries since 2007 have included ten Alexander Dennis Enviro300, four Alexander Dennis Enviro200 Darts and fifteen Optare Solos.
On the double-deck side of the fleet, 35 Alexander Dennis Enviro400s entered service in 2009, mainly displacing Volvo Olympians. Twenty-three of the Enviro400s are for routes through the Mersey Tunnels, these being the first vehicles in the fleet to carry the interurban (now standard) variant of Arriva livery, apart from a solitary demonstrator. Previously, 30 Volvo B7TL with Alexander ALX400 bodywork had entered service on services between Liverpool and Garston in 2006, these being supplemented by seven mid-life DAF DB250 with similar bodywork from Arriva London, and three Dennis Trident 2 with Plaxton President bodywork acquired with the Blue Bus business in Bolton. Volvo Olympians currently form the majority of the non-low-floor double-deck fleet. In 2010, further ALX400s from London started to arrive.
Unusual vehicles in the fleet include the Ikarus 481 and Polaris bodies on DAF SB220 chassis, acquired with the Blue Bus fleet. The seven Polaris bodies account for a majority of those imported. Until October 2008, twelve Neoplan N4016 were operated on service 18A from Liverpool to Croxteth Park, and were the only vehicles of their type in Britain.
A number of articulated vehicles were earmarked to join the fleet from Arriva London, although the three that arrived on Merseyside for trialling purposes later moved on to Arriva Midlands. They were expected to have been based at Green Lane, suited by its drive-through maintenance pits, and Speke depots.
