Mainichi Issho is part of the   game series that revolves around the Toro cat character. Episodes spawned on the PlayStation series of home and handleheld consoles starting in 1999 with the original PlayStation. Since then various sequels and sidestories were released including on Windows systems and cell phones such as the imode. Even though the franchise is popular in Japan and known in South-East Asia, no game had a western release yet.
Mainichi Issho is the 12th game in the series and was made available for free download on the Japanese PlayStation Store on the PlayStation 3's launch date in November 2006. It is preceded and followed by two cell phone games.
Mainichi Issho includes various features coming from different genres, from news to mini-games to online communication to artificial life which makes it an original crossgenre game. Though SCEJ marketed it as a "casual net" (                  ) genre game. Among its more noticeable innovations are real time screenshot capture, in-game XMB access (Friend, Internet browser, BGM selection, HDD video upload, etc.) and Remote Play.
When no modes are selected, Mainichi Issho runs in autoplay and becomes a traditional artificial life game. Then Toro interacts with available items or do "ordinary" actions such as dancing, cleaning his apartment, reading, playing, phoning, drinking milk from his fridge, sleeping, or going to the toilet (from where he reads a newspaper). Since the game is performed in real time, these actions can vary with the time of the day or the night. New actions are added as new version updates or items become available.  
Main menu modes are listed as following:
The ToroStation (                           ) delivers a semi-interactive blog-like daily news in a parody of the NHK Daily News show. News are presented with humor by Toro and Kuro in the manzai duet tradition.
Nyavatar (               ) is a portmanteau of "nya", the Japanese cat scream (the equivalent of "meow") and "avatar" intended as the alternate identity used to personify someone on the Internet.
A Nyavatar is the user's alter-ego inside the game. Creating a nyavatar is free of charge, but clothes (cosplay) and extra accessories are purchased with real money (yen) through the Mainichi Issho Store.
Mochimono (            ) or "personal effects" is the place for items related actions. 
Okaimono (               ) is the place for shopping game items. Purchased items can be used or send to a friend.
Besides ToroStation occasional mini-games there are three full mini-games (         ).
A game center, where you can buy 'medals' to play on the arcade machines there. You can either buy 10 for 100 yen, or 60 for 500 yen. Each game costs 1 medal to play.
Selecting "Friend" (            ) allows online communication with other users, including written messages and chat through the XMB standard feature. It is also possible to send presents, Mainichi Issho items, to be used in a friend's game.
Later in 2008, a PSP version was released on the PlayStation Store. It's just like the PS3 version, The only exception is that you can download a free costume mini-game.
