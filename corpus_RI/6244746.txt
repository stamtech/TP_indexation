Khan began on the competitive   at the age of 13. Other StarCraft professionals include fellow Team PokerStars member Bertrand "ElkY" Grospellier. Khan is also known within the Marvel vs Capcom 2 community. 
Khan's nickname "RaiNKhaN" was adapted, along with his last name, from the Mortal Kombat character "Rain," who serves as an assassin for Shao Kahn in the series. Khan dropped out from SUNY Albany in order to concentrate on playing poker professionally. Khan is known to multi-table many online tournaments, so much so that he had a friend of his film him for a YouTube video in which he played 26 sit-and-go tournaments simultaneously on a single computer monitor to prove that he wasn't a Pokerbot. On March 23, 2008, Khan won the PokerStars ''Sunday Warm-up'', a weekly $215 buy-in tournament in which he outlasted a field of 2,504 players in more than 9 hours of play earning $97,856. 
At the 2007 World Series of Poker Main Event Khan finished in in sixth place earning $956,243. He also finished in the money during two other WSOP events. For the 2008 World Series of Poker a new rule was in effect, known as the "Hevad Khan Rule". The rule was drafted as a response to the outrageous, over the top actions Hevad employed during the 2007 Series when he won a hand. Boisterous celebrations are no longer allowed.   It has been suggested as a reason why he was not as successful in 2008.
At the 2008 Foxwoods Poker Classic, Khan won the $1,850 No Limit Hold'em event, earning $108,187, after defeating 2006 World Series of Poker third place finalist Michael Binger during heads-up play.
