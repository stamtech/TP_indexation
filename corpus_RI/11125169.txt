The '''2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois''' will be held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012 to elect the 18 U.S. Representatives from the state, one from each of the state's 18 congressional districts, a loss of one seat following the 2010 United States Census. The elections will coincide with the elections of other federal and state offices, including a quadrennial presidential election.
A redistricting bill was introduced to the Illinois General Assembly by members of the Democratic Party in May 2011. Although Representatives are not required to live within their districts, the new map draws the homes of at least five Republican incumbents into districts where they will have to run against other Republicans, and others into districts which strongly favor Democrats. Republicans in the Illinois congressional delegation issued a statement reading "Under the cover of darkness, the Democrats in Springfield proposed a new Congressional map that was drawn without any input from Republicans or any consideration for the hours of testimony offered at public hearings this spring." The state is currently represented by 11 Republicans; however, there are expected to be only seven districts in which Republicans can run competitively.
After an amendment which modified the 13th and 15th districts was passed with Republican support, the new map was passed by the Illinois House of Representatives on May 30, 2011 and the Senate on May 31. Governor Pat Quinn, a Democrat, has said he will only sign the map into law if it is "fair". The Republican Party or another group may challenge the map in a federal court on the grounds that, under the Voting Rights Act, a second majority-Hispanic district is necessary.
The 1st district, which has been represented by Democrat Bobby Rush since 1993, had seen a decline in population and so now extends into the Chicago suburbs and rural areas of Will County.
Adam Kinzinger, who was first elected to represent the 11th district in 2010, now lives in the 2nd district, which has been represented by Democrat Jesse Jackson, Jr. since 1999.
The 3rd district, which has been represented by Democrat Dan Lipinski since 2005, now extends to Bridgeport, Chicago and Lockport, Will County.
Insurance executive and health care activist John Atkinson was expected to challenge incumbent Lipinski, and raised over $535,000 in the first quarter of 2011, but no longer lives in Lipinski's district. Atkinson may instead run in the 11th district. On May 28, 2011, Atkinson said he was evaluating where to run.
The 4th district, which has been represented by Democrat Luis Gutierrez since 1993, extends to incorporate Gutierrez's new home in Portage Park.
The 5th district, which has been represented by Democrat Michael Quigley since 2009, was redrawn to include Wrigleyville, O'Hare International Airport and western Hinsdale, where the home of Republican U.S. Representative Judy Biggert, who has represented the 13th district since 1999, is located. Biggert may choose to challenge Quigley.
The 6th district, which has been represented by Republican Peter Roskam since 2007, is one of two districts which are expected to remain strongly favorable to Republicans.
Joe Walsh, a Republican who was first elected to represent the 8th district in 2010, no longer lives within its redrawn boundaries.
Raja Krishnamoorthi, a former deputy state treasurer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Illinois Comptroller in 2010, said in May 2011 that he would form an exploratory committee to run for the 8th district. Tammy Duckworth, a former official in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Illinois's 6th congressional district in 2006, may also run. Melissa Bean, a Democrat who represented the 8th district from 2005 until 2011, said in April 2011 that she would not run in 2012, and in June 2011 endorsed Krishnamoorthi's campaign.
Robert Dold, who was first elected to represent the 10th district in 2010, now lives in the 9th district, which has been represented by Democrat Jan Schakowsky since 1999.
Robert Dold, who was first elected to represent the 10th district in 2010, no longer lives in the redrawn district.
Ilya Sheyman, a Democrat and community organizer from Waukegan, said in April 2011 that he would run for what is now an open seat, and Brad Schneider, a business consultant from Deerfield, announced his bid for the Democratic nomination on May 25, 2011.
Adam Kinzinger, who was first elected to represent the 11th district in 2010, now lives in the 2nd district, which has been represented by Democrat Jesse Jackson, Jr. since 1999. The newly-drawn 11th district includes the Democratic-leaning areas of Joliet and Aurora.
Bill Foster, a Democrat who represented the 14th district from 2008 until 2011, is expected to announce his candidacy for the 11th district on May 31, 2011.
Insurance executive and health care activist John Atkinson, who had previously planned to challenge fellow Democrat Dan Lipinski in the 3rd district, may instead run in the 11th district. On May 28, 2011, Atkinson said he was evaluating where to run. Tom Weisner, the mayor of Aurora, also may run. State representative Linda Chapa LaVia and state senator Linda Holmes, both Democrats, have denied interest in running.
Aurora alderman Richard Irvin, a Republican, plans to form an exploratory committee in order to run. U.S. Representatives Judy Biggert, who has represented the 13th district since 1999, and Randy Hultgren, who has represented the 14th district since January 2011, also may run. Republican state senator Chris Lauzen has denied interest.
The new 13th district consists of Calhoun, Christian, De Witt, Greene, Jersey,  Macon, Macoupin,  Montgomery and  Piatt counties along with parts of  Bond,  Champaign,  Madison, and Sangamon counties. As a result, Hinsdale native and Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, who has represented the 13th district since 1999, no longer lives in the redrawn district. However, Republican Tim Johnson, who has represented the 15th district since 2001, is likely to run.
State representative Jay Hoffman and physician David Gill may run for the Democratic nomination to challenge Johnson. Democrat Debbie Halvorson, who represented the 11th district from 2009 until 2011 and may run in the 13th district in 2012, said in April 2011 that she was waiting to see the new boundaries before deciding whether to run for Congress again. Democratic state senator Mike Frerichs will not run.
Republican Randy Hultgren was first elected to represent the 14th district in 2010. Joe Walsh, who was first elected to represent the 8th district in 2010, now lives in the 14th district, and may challenge Hultgren in the Republican primary. Bill Foster, a Democrat who represented the 14th district from 2008 until 2011 is expected to run in the 11th district in 2012; however leaders in the Illinois General Assembly would prefer Foster to run in the 14th district, where his home is located.
The home of Republican John Shimkus, who has represented the now-obsolete 19th district since 2003 and represented the 20th district (eliminated after redistricting following the 2000 Census) from 1997 until 2003, is located within the new 15th district, which includes eastern Madison County and southeastern Illinois. In an earlier draft of the map, Shimkus's home was drawn into the 13th district.
Republicans Adam Kinzinger and Joe Walsh, who have represented the 11th and 8th districts respectively since January 2011 but no longer live within the boundaries of those districts, may instead challenge fellow Republican Donald Manzullo, who has represented the 16th district since 1993. The new 16th district has moved south to incorporate Livingston and Iroquois Counties and parts of Ford County.
The 17th district was extended into Rock Island, Moline, Rockford, Peoria and Tazewell County, thereby making it more favorable to Democrats. Republican Bobby Schilling, who has represented the district since January 2011, will run for re-election.
State senator Dave Koehler will seek the Democratic nomination. Former state representative Mike Boland, East Moline alderwoman Cheri Bustos, and former Rock Island mayor Mark Schwiebert, all of whom are Democrats, may also run. Democrat Phil Hare, who represented the district from 2007 until 2011, will not run again.
The 18th district, which has been represented by Republican Aaron Schock since 2009, was extended into Bloomington-Normal and as far as the Mississippi River. Schock's hometown of Peoria will be split between the 17th and 18th districts. The district is one of two which are expected to remain strongly favorable to Republicans.
