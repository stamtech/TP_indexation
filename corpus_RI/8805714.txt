James Frederick Mitchell was born in Manchester on 18 November 1897, and he attended Arnold Grammar School and Manchester University.
Mitchell spent time with a number of different clubs including Blackpool, Northern Nomads, Preston North End, Manchester City and Leicester City. Mitchell played in leagues including the Football League and Lancashire Combination. He started his career with Football League outfit Blackpool, joining them in the 1914&ndash;15 season at the age of 17. He played five league matches for the club, deputising for Jimmy Kidd. He made his debut in a goalless draw against Lincoln City at Bloomfield Road on 20 March. Fred Thompson stood in for three matches, before Mitchell returned to the team for the final four games.
Mitchell left Preston in 1922 to join Manchester City and between 1922 and 1926, he played a total of 109 games for Manchester City, 99 of them in the Football League. He played 17 times in the league as Manchester City were relegated to the Football League Second Division at the end of the 1925&ndash;26 campaign. After leaving the club in 1926, Mitchell spent one season with Leicester City. However, he failed to make a first team appearance for the club, and retired from professional football in 1927.
While playing for Manchester City, Mitchell earned one international cap for the England national side on 22 October 1924, in a game against Ireland; England ran out as 3   1 victors.  The match, which was held at the Goodison Park stadium in Liverpool, was part of the 1925 British Home Championship. Mitchell also wore spectacles in that game, and to date he remains the only player capped for England while wearing spectacles.
Mitchell also represented Great Britain at the 1920 Summer Olympics.
Mitchell died at the age of 77 on 30 May 1975.
