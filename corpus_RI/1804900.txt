The '''Treasury Casino''', also known as '''The Treasury''' is a casino in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It also houses a hotel, five restaurants, seven bars, and a nightclub. The casino is operated by Tabcorp Holdings.
One per cent of the casino's gross gaming revenue is deposited in the Jupiters Casino Community Benefit Fund. This fund supports non-profit community based groups and is administered by the Government of Queensland.
The casino and hotel occupy two of Australia's grandest heritage buildings, the Treasury Building, and the nearby Lands Administration Building. The buildings are separated by Queens Park. A 700&nbsp;vehicle carpark is located beneath the park.
An early 19th century building with Edwardian-Baroque exterior designs and ornate colonnades, striking sandstone walls and six-story atrium, the historic Treasury Building houses a three-level gaming emporium of 80 gaming tables and over 1300 gaming machines and was opened refurbished as the Treasury Casino in April 1995.
The hotel section of the Conrad Treasury Casino is housed in the former Lands Administration Building. 
There are also function rooms, each with its own personality and design sense, available for booking. These rooms range from early 19th century designed to modern business meeting rooms.
Treasury offers a number of gambling games:
In the evening, the casino lights up with RGB-LED lights and an array of attractions such as dances and music bands are performed for the entertainment of its customers. Celebrity poker tournaments have also been held at the Treasury.
