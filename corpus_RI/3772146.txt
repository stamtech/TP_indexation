The '''economy of Ontario''' is rich and diversified.  Ontario is the largest economy in Canada, its GDP being nearly twice that of neighbouring Quebec, the second largest economy. The Ontarian economy is highly influenced, and run by the service sector, though manufacturing also plays an important role.

In the 19th century, Ontario was mostly unexplored and the amount of natural resources within the province was yet to be recognized, though it was thought of to be very narrow in terms of economic prosperity. Vast amount of land in the province was forest, at the time, the demand for lumber was enormous as wood was needed for heating and building ships, houses, furniture and railways. During the Napoleonic wars, Britain was cut off from its wood supply from the Baltic Sea and was in desperate need for wood. Since 1893, however, this has been renewed.

The ''Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009'' (GEGEA), takes a two-pronged approach to creating a renewable-energy economy. The first is to bring more renewable energy sources to the province and the second is the creation of more energy efficiency measures to help conserve energy. The bill would also appoint a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide "one-window" assistance and support to project developers in order to facilitate project approvals. The approvals process for transmission projects would also be  d and for the first time in Ontario, the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels. Solar panels are also manufactured in Ontario.
