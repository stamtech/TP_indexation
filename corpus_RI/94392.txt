Canfield is a relatively affluent suburb of Youngstown, with strict zoning regulations that prohibit large signage and overgrown lawns. A tree-lined "Village Green" sits at the heart of the New England-style village, which resembles many communities established in the days of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The town center is a venue for a wide range of community activities.
In 1992, Canfield city residents, although surrounded completely by Canfield Township, voted to secede from the township. This motion created two separate governmental entities     one a municipality, the other a township. However this did not destroy the community spirit that exists between both the city and township. Both cooperate with each other for the mutual benefit of their particular constituents. An example of this is mutual fire protection service, communications with each other with respect to roads and highways, and the physical assets of both (schools, parks, etc.).
The Canfield Local School District serves the city of Canfield, Canfield Township, and a small portion of Boardman and Beaver Townships.

The Canfield Cardinals High School Football team was awarded the runner-up trophy in the Division II state championship held in Massillon, Ohio in 2005.

The 2007 Canfield High School Baseball Team was awarded with the 2007 Division II State Championship in May 2007; the Cardinals defeated Kenton Ridge in the State final game.  It is the school's first ever team state championship. The same year, Audra Frimpong won the state title in long jump at the state championships for track and field. In June 2008, the Canfield High School girl's softball team won the state championship.  Canfield's marching band is called the Cardinal Pride Marching Band.
