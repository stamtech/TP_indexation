The '''House of Jamalullail''' of the Perak branch is one of the oldest Syed clans in Malaysia. It was established in 1528 C.E. when Saidina Hussain Al-Faradz Al-Jamalullail from Hadramaut arrived in Perak to spread Islam. 
According to R.O. Winstedt in his article titled The Hadramaut Saiyids of Perak and Siak which was published in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (September 1918), there was a certain Sayid family that exercised great influence on the history of Perak in the 18th century. The family acquired the highest state offices, those of Orang Kaya Besar and of Menteri, and one of its members acted even as Bendahara. Scions of this Sayid house were sought for eagerly in marriage and married into the families of all the greater Perak chiefts. One married the sister of Sultan Iskandar (whose reign is described in the  ) and was the father of a Perak Sultan.
The following family tree was redrafted from R.O. Winstedt's article The Hadramaut Saiyids of Perak and Siak. Additional genealogical information was retrieved from the book A History of Perak by Winstedt and R.J. Wilkinson in 1934.
