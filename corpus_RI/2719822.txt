The BeaverTails pastry is similar to several other fried dough pastries and is topped with various condiments. BeaverTails Canada Inc. through franchising currently operates 33 stores and 43 BeaverTails stands worldwide.
BeaverTails pastries began when Grant and Pam Hooker decided to turn their family recipe for fried dough into a corporate business. In 1980, the Hookers opened up the first BeaverTails stand in the Byward Market in Ottawa two years after they had formed BeaverTails Canada Inc. 
The company expanded within Canada and then internationally in the 1990s. In 2002 the company moved its head office to Montreal and focused on domestic development. However, since 2008 international development had been reinitiated.
The product received national media attention in the US and Canada when it was served at the Canadian embassy during Obama's inauguration and was mentioned in newscasts during the lead-up to U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Ottawa, as an example of how Canadian businesses were participating in Obama's visit. On the day of the visit, February 19, 2009, Barack Obama stopped at the ByWard Market on his way to the airport specifically to buy a BeaverTails pastry. One variation of the product was called the "Obama Tail", specifically in honour of the president's visit to Ottawa.
