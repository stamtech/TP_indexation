Though he has since been honored with numerous exhibitions and prizes, Mitchell said that "In the seventies no one wanted to represent me because I was black." His inclusion in a 2002 exhibition ''Black Romantic'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem led to a full page color reproduction of his work in ''The New York Times'', with favorable commentary by critic Michael Kimmelman, who wrote "Mr. Mitchell's works are subtly tuned character studies with an eye toward abstract form and charismatic light. Mr. Mitchell is a virtual modern-day Vermeer of ordinary black people given dignity through the eloquence of his concentration and touch."Kimmelman, Michael. . ''New York Times'', April 26, 2002. Retrieved July 31, 2010. For cultural critic Reginald Gant, Mitchell   s art "comes right out of the African-American experience. It   s the result of an aural construct      call and response      that evolved during slavery (one group of slaves would sing out, and another group would respond). Imperative in these exchanges were issues of faith, trust, and perseverance.". Charlotte Street Foundation. Retrieved July 31, 2010.
