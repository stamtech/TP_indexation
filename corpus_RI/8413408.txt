Tuvalu's power has come from imported diesel brought in by ships. The large power station (2000 kW) on the main island receives the fuel directly; however, for the small power stations on the outlying islands (20 - 70 kW each), fuel has to be transferred to 200 liter (55 gallon) barrels and offloaded from the ships. A small project to power the inter-island telecommunications systems by photovoltaics began in 1979 but was mismanaged.
The first part of the conversion to renewables was a 40 kW solar panel installation on the roof of a sports stadium which supplies 5% of the power needs of the capital, Funafuti. Future plans include expanding this plant to 60 kW. A 46 kW solar installation with battery storage at the Motufoua Secondary School on Vaitupu island was brought online on 27 November 2009. Wind power is also mentioned as a future electricity source. A non-profit, Alofa Tuvalu, is promoting solar water heating and solar ovens as well as investigating producing biogas, biodiesel and ethanol.
Tuvalu, barely about sea level at any point, is concerned over global warming and sea level rise and see its use of renewable energy as a moral example for others whose influence is greater. Kausea Natano, Tuvalu's minister for public utilities and industries stated this as "We thank those who are helping Tuvalu reduce its carbon footprint as it will strengthen our voice in upcoming international negotiations. And we look forward to the day when our nation offers an example to all -- powered entirely by natural resources such as the sun and the wind."
