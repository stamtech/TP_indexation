The nickname came from an idea from the band's manager, Sandy Pearlman, who envisioned each member of the band having an unusual stage name; Roeser was the only one who took to the idea, and his was the only name that stuck.
His other equipment use includes: a ''Giuliano Balestra Vulcan'', a Fender Stratocaster, a ''St. Blues'' and custom models built by ''Rick Kresiak'', ''Harper Guitars'' and ''Warren Guitars''. Many of his guitars were made by White Plains based custom guitar maker, Guliano.
