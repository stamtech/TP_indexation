Tomko is chiefly noted as the runner-up in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) $10,000 no limit Texas hold'em main event in both 1982 (to Jack Straus) and 2001 (to Carlos Mortensen.)
Tomko began playing poker profitably as a 16-year-old in Pittsburgh pool halls which allowed him to finance his education. He worked as a kindergarten teacher, but often played poker through the night. Tomko realised that poker was more profitable than his job and invested a sum of his winnings into businesses while choosing to play poker full-time.
Tomko has played every WSOP Main Event since 1974 which is currently the longest active streak.
Recently, Tomko took third place in the 2005 WSOP Deuce-to-seven lowball event worth $138,160.
Tomko is married with three children. His son Derek encouraged him to return to playing poker tournaments. (Tomko claims his son is a better player than he was at his age.)
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $4,960,000. Just over half of his tournament winnings, $2,641,573, have come at the WSOP.  He is a 2008 inductee into the Poker Hall of Fame.
Rick Reilly chronicles a day with Dewey on a golf course in his book ''Who's Your Caddy''.  In it, he contends that Tomko is not interested in competition if there is not a wager riding on it.  Dewey is just as good a gambler on the golf course as he is sitting at a poker table.  He notes that many PGA professionals will refuse to play him for money. On NBC's Poker After Dark, Greg Raymer noted that pro golfer Rocco Mediate has said that if he had one person to putt for his life, it would be Tomko.
