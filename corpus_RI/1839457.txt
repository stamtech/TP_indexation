Mitchell was signed as a free agent by Saskatchewan in 2000 after being released from Edmonton Eskimos training camp.  He was recognized as an All-Star in the 2003 CFL season. He attended the Miami Dolphins' (National Football League) training camp in 1999, signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2002 and released, and signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 2003 and released. In college, he played for Southern University.
Mitchell was waived following the 2006 CFL season and granted a release he requested from Saskatchewan in January 2007, after not receiving a contract offer. It was largely seen as a cost-saving move to meet the new CFL salary cap.
