The book alleges inconsistencies and fabrications in Obama's life story as well as a conspiracy and cover-up by Obama and the White House Press office. The book says, among other things, that Obama cannot be a natural-born citizen because as a boy, he was registered in school as a Muslim and a citizen of Indonesia. The book also says that Obama spent millions in legal fees to avoid having to provide a long-form birth certificate to the courts, an assertion which has been disputed by Obama supporters. In the book, Corsi acknowledges that radio host James Edwards helped him with his research. 
Martin Wisckol of the ''Orange County Register'' reported June 1, 2011 that Corsi's new book was "listed at No. 6 on the The ''New York Times best-seller list'' for hardcover non-fiction" but suggested that the failure of Corsi's previous book ''Obama Nation'' to derail Barrack Obama's bid for the presidency was "evidence the book will not affect the upcoming election" like ''Unfit for Command'' did Kerry's presidential run four years earlier.
Corsi, who holds a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University, is the author of five best-sellers, including ''Unfit for Command'', which sold 1.2 million copies. Corsi has previously published a book on Obama titled '' '' (2008), that alleges Obama is a far left-wing militant Muslim with extensive ties to radical elements in Kenya. The book also theorizes that Bill Ayers, the head of the 1960s terrorist group the Weather Underground, wrote Obama's 2006 book, ''The Audacity of Hope''.
According to an opinion piece in ''The Guardian'', the publisher, WND Books, is "a niche producer of rightwing conspiracy theories, religious books and 'family values' tracts". WND Books describes itself as a subsidiary of WorldNetDaily that "specializes in adult nonfiction titles with an emphasis on current events, politics, and history."
