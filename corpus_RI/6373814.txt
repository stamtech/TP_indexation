The result was    '''speedy delete''' as the creation of a banned user.  If anyone finds this a worthwhile topic and wants to create it from scratch, this deletion does not preclude such a decision. --  ( ) 19:28, 19 May 2008 (UTC)
The only reason any of these subjects are mentioned is because of their connection to Barack Obama.  As is often brought up in these discussions, notability is not inherited and none of the subjects are otherwise notable. Obama's coffee mug is also often mentioned in articles about him but we don't need to start an article called "Coffee mug of Barack Obama."  
This article is no different than the previous article on Malia Obama created by the same banned user which was speedily deleted for the same reasons.  See  for the archived discussion.  All of the same arguments apply here.    ( ) 01:47, 17 May 2008 (UTC)
