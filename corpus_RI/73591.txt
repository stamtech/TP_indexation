Original Spanish explorers settled on the enormous ranchos by land grants made by the King of Spain. Manuel Nieto of the Portola Expeditions received such a grant in 1783, which was divided by his heirs into five separate ranchos in 1834. One of them,  Rancho Los Coyotes, included the current site of the City of Buena Park where the rancho   s adobe headquarters was located on what is now Los Coyotes Country Club   s golf course.
The area was transferred from Spanish authority to Mexican rule in 1822 and ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican-American War. California was granted statehood in 1850. Americanization further expanded in the area after completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 and its connection to Los Angeles in 1875. By then, Abel Stearns had acquired Rancho Los Coyotes in consideration for loans made to Pio and Andres Pico. In 1885, James A. Whitaker purchased  of this land from Stearns and in 1887 he founded the City of Buena Park in conjunction with the railway development of what we now know as Orange County. The city was incorporated in 1953. An agricultural center when founded (particularly dairy, wine and citrus products) the city is now primarily a residential suburb and commercial hub.
Buena Park's E-Zone district, located along Beach Boulevard, is home to several well-known tourist destinations: the venerable Knott's Berry Farm theme park and its sister water park Knott's Soak City, Pirate's Dinner Adventure Show, and a Medieval Times dinner show. The Movieland Wax Museum, one of the largest of its kind in the world, was once located in the E-Zone until it closed in 2005. The Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum, across the street from the Wax Museum, has also been vacated. There also used to be a Japanese Village and Deer Park on Knott Avenue. The E-Zone also neighbors Anaheim, with Disneyland just east by way of Katella Avenue, Ball Road, and Interstate 5.
Los Coyotes Country Club is prized by people from Buena Park. It boasts three distinct nine-hole layouts. Originally designed by Billy Bell in 1957 and redesigned by Ted Robinson in 1998, Los Coyotes    27-hole championship course blends the area   s natural beauty with undulating fairways, well-protected greens and numerous lakes. The LPGA Tour also had the Los Coyotes LPGA Classic golf tournament here. The Los Coyotes Country Club is also home to Orange County and Buena Park's most coveted and expensive real estate properties. 
The Ralph B. Clark Regional Park is also another special point of interest in Buena Park. Nestled at the foot of the Coyote Hills, it is one of Orange County's prominent parks. The 105 acre property extends north and south of Rosecrans Avenue with the softball complex. The park lands range from large open grass areas, to gently rolling hills of native plants, to shear sandstone cliffs to the north. The park's impressive amenities include: an amphitheater, barbecues, baseball/softball fields, bicycling, fire rings, fishing, group picnic areas, hiking trails, horseshoe pits, Interpretive Center & Museum, interpretive programs, model sail boating, picnic tables, picnic shelters, playground equipment, tennis courts, and volleyball courts. 
The City of Buena Park has its own local history park located on Beach Blvd just south of Interstate 5. On these grounds, the city has preserved several historic buildings. These include the Whitaker-Jaynes House (which serves as the city's local history museum) the Bacon House - possibly the oldest surviving structure from the area, the Stage Stop Hotel (which houses the current Chamber of Commerce offices) and the Tice House. The Buena Park Historical Society manages and maintains the historical content of the museum. The Dreger Clock, a 75 year old multi-faced street clock, best known for the time it spent at Knott's Berry Farm, was installed in front of the Whitaker/Jaynes house overlooking Beach Blvd in September 2009 after a two year restoration project.
