The CFL re-signed with Carling O'Keefe Breweries to another record television contract worth $33 million to cover a three-year period from 1983 to 1986.
The league's attendance levels reached an all-time high for all football games with 2,856,031. The Grey Cup game between the Toronto Argonauts and the BC Lions was played in front of 59,345 football fans at BC Place Stadium (the first lion gross gate).
In addition, CBC, CTV and Radio-Canada's coverage of the Grey Cup game attracted the largest viewing audience in television history for a Canadian sports program with 8,118,000.
The Toronto Argonauts won their first Grey Cup Championship since 1952.
Terry Greer set a pro football record for most receiving yards with 2,003. This record is as great as O.J. Simpson's 2,003 rushing yds in '73, Jim Brown's 1,863 yds rushing in '63 or Gale Sayers' 22 tds in 1965. It can even be seen as better since the CFL plays only three downs to the NFL's four. He also had three 200 yd ball games in a season (also a league record).
Many people believe he should have won the MOP (Most Outstanding Player), however it was hard to argue with Warren Moon's 5,600 yds passing. This was Warren Moon's last season in Canada before his Hall Of Fame career in the NFL.  Peter Ross
