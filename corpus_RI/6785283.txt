A tote bag is large and open (smaller versions became more popular by late nineties), with a handle centered atop each side. In the classic cloth version, arched straps form both handles.  Straps' ends run down both sides, ending under the second fabric layer there, which shields the lower surfaces.  Since the advent of cell phones and PDAs, the side-pouch and zipper-topped partition have grown common.  
The archetypal tote is of sturdy cloth, perhaps with thick leather at handles or bottom; all-leather versions often have a pebbled surface . Common fabrics include heavy canvas, often dyed, perhaps treated to resist moisture and mold. Jute is another traditional material, though less popular. In recent decades, heavy nylon and other easy-care synthetics have become common, though most tend to degrade with prolonged sun-exposure. And today's inexpensive/free tote is often made from recycled matter, from minimally-processed natural fibers, or from byproducts of process that refine organic materials.  
The term tote, meaning "to carry", can be traced back to the 17th century but was not used to describe bags until 1900.  Generally a tote holds diverse objects of modest value, its contents varying day-to-day:  portable umbrellas, books, towels, stadium/picnic blankets, and other recreational gear;  perhaps beverages, finger foods, spare clothes, makeup/dopp kits, and child-care items -- all piled atop a set of keys, a cell phone, perhaps a wallet or change purse to hold pocket money.;  
Some companies offer totes as a way to raise awareness and promote a cause by branding the tote with their logo or message.  For instance,  uses a canvas tote branded with their logo to help promote their shelter products which are used in disaster relief and transitional shelter situations.
