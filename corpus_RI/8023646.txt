I'm afraid I can't tell what is wrong with your file, except for the size.  I use Inkscape, but I have a few ideas. If you have problems with your fonts, Inkscape has a "Path->Convert Objects to Path" command that allows SVG to render 'non-standard' fonts. It may be that Cyrillic (excuse me if I spelled it wrong), or your specific font is one of the non-standard ones. You could try another font. If Illustrator is converting all the fonts to SVG path objects automatically, that would explain the size difference. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful, but I hope that at least explains the mystery.   ( ) 03:27, 6 April 2009 (UTC)
A relatively straightforward, but a very useful addition (IMO) would be an SVG scheme of a tokamak device. It could be based on one of the existing pictures...

The reason that I'm requesting this is that I've been cleaning inadequately labeled images on :sl Wikipedia and noticed  . It's very informative, so I'd like to replace it in the article instead of just deleting. I can provide translation of the labels if necessary.
Since being with Wikipedia, I created a large collection of images by hand-drawing them. Can these be CGI'-ed (converted to computer images)?
The files include the following (my additional schematics besides those below can be seen at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:KVDP (click gallery)):
Note that I did not upload the image at the site noted, if a new image is made in a simplified form, it can propbably be uploaded as a derivate or self-made image at wiki commons This image is for use with incineration and landfill mining article and is useful as it can give people around the world an idea on how they can eliminate their landfill sites.   
A schematic of the waterpumping windmill described in  schould also be made and uploaded to wikimedia commons.
At present, I would firstly like to request the making of the following image:
ForestCoverWorld.JPG
This image is to be created from the image found at  and the 
Can someone please make a open-source copy from these maps and upload them to wiki commons, after which they can be displayed at the deforestation article. The image should be the IntactForests image layered over a pencil line marking the extremeties of the howstuffworks vegetation cover map. Note that it is perhaps best to move the intactforest coloring to the howstuffworks map, add the pencil line and delete the howstuffworks coloring
The area between the pencil line and the still currently present vegation, should be colored red; Vegetation (current) should be green.
A final image can be a modified image of  ; where the the solar panel is cut off and where it is stated that the 2 pipes connect to a external (passive) source; eg a ground, water solar or air source; eg via heat pump, deep surface water (see also:  ) or solar panel (see image above)   Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 16:52, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

I spent about 10 minutes tracing  , but it's nowhere near done yet. If someone else wants to improve on it, please do. Cheers,   ( ) 23:53, 27 April 2009 (UTC)
The first version is .  Feedback would be nice before I update the .png version with this. -  ( ) 16:00, 24 April 2009 (UTC)

Greetings, I'm looking for a decent-quality image of Wikia founders Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley. The best I could find is  , but that includes unnecessary detail and is rather grainy. If there are no superior alternatives, could someone see if they could improve this image? Thanks,   14:44, 20 April 2009 (UTC)
Did the best I can, however the dimension for the Vice Chief is somehow different, If exact info is given I will make it more accurate but here goes!: 
PS the dimension of the CofS and the Sec, I did a round up of the US Presidential flag.   ( )  07:16, 28 April, 2009 (UTC)

Huh? I'm a little confused.    20:10, 29 April 2009 (UTC)
Hi Ejly, you've loaded up a version which is basically just a LoC thumbnail created for cataloging purposes.  However, here  is a much higher resolution version of the photograph.  (Also, here is a 20+MB version .)  Can I suggest you load the first version up (ie ) and then see if it suits your purposes. You can then come back here and ask us if you need any more help.  Also, can I suggest you load the file up onto , it is quite easy to do and to create an account there. Regards. --  ( ) 07:03, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
Fixed it I think, took the liberty to change it on the article --  ( ) 22:11, 2 May 2009 (UTC)
Could you use the more goldish yellow like in the emblem? (The source on the emblem is directly from the CIS website, the flag doesnt have a direct source so I think the more goldish yellow colour is the correct colour.) Also when you have made the correction, could you upload under the new name and tag the misspelled one for deletion? Thanks--  ( ) 20:12, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
Great work Goldblattster! Thanks--  ( ) 09:37, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

I see "prefettura di YYZ" in the image.  Should this be changed to "YYZ Prefecture"? --  ( ) 16:15, 24 April 2009 (UTC)
Here is one I attempted vector. Not the best work, but may be worth it. '''  ''' 07:23, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
To the requester: Can you find (or write) what the text in the circle should be? It's almost impossible to tell what parts of it are actual text and what parts are JPEG compression artifacts since none of us can read the alphabet used.   ( ) 17:39, 3 May 2009 (UTC)
Great, I love 40k, I'll take this on.--    10:03, 4 May 2009 (UTC)
Sorry about the late reply. Is this alright for the stub icon?
I agree that at this size the text was not really needed. I am glad you like the design!--    16:42, 5 May 2009 (UTC)
Hows that?    19:13, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
Also, please convert the Yemen coat of arms to a SVG, as I feel it is not appropriate to be held as a JPG. Some larger images can be found

Vector'd from  source, will that work? The source wasn't that great so there isn't much detail left...    &nbsp; &nbsp;( &nbsp;|&nbsp; ) 05:11, 26 May 2009 (UTC)
