The '''Kingdom of Belgium''' produces over half of its electricity through nuclear energy. Belgium is a federal state. The energy policy is mainly set by the three regions (for example green certificates) but the federal government has jurisdiction in some areas, including the country's nuclear policy - namely keeping or closing the Belgium's two nuclear plants. As for other member countries, the European Union sets general policies such as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. Belgium takes part in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and has signed the Kyoto Protocol. At the federal level, Minister Paul Magnette is in charge of climate change.
The companies Blue Sky, Umicore, BASF, Solvay, Duferco, Tessenderlo, ArcelorMittal, and Air Liquide make together 15% of the total energy consumption of Belgium.
Own energy production was 25 % compared to primary energy use in 2008. 
In 1990, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 146.9 million tons of  equivalent (Mt  eq), whose 88 millions tons came from the Flemish Region,  54.8 from the Walloon Region and 4 Mt from the Brussels-capital Region.
Being a member of the European Union, Belgium, applied the European Union Emission Trading Scheme set up by the Directive 2003/87/EC. The Kyoto protocol sets a 7.5 % reduction of greenhouse gas emission target compared to 1990. Belgium set up a National Allocation Plan at the federal level with target for each of the three regions.
On 14 November 2002, Belgium signed the ''Cooperation Agreement for the implementation of a National Climate Plan and reporting in the context of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol''. The first National Allocation Plan was for the period from 2005 to 2007. The European commission approved it on 20 October 2004. The second allocation plan was for the period 2008-2012 and aims a reduction of 7.5% of green house gas emissions compared to 1990.
Electrabel is main producer of electricity. Elia System Operator is the company that transports electiricity and there are local companies (that may be public, private of public and private) that manage the local grid. Some of the electricity is produced domestically, some is imported. Belgium also exports electricity to its neighbours.
In 2000, Belgium produced 78,85 TWh.http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/nap_belgium_final.pdf,                DRAFT of ''Belgian National Allocation Plan for CO2-emission allowances 2008-2012'', September 2006
In 2000, nuclear power contributed to 58.24% of the 78.85 TWh (total rate: 9 GWe) produced domestically.
As of 2006, about 56% of electricity comes from nuclear energy.
Belgium has two nuclear power plants:
By law (the "Wet op de kernuitstap") the nuclear power plants are scheduled to close in 2014, but it is widely assumed that the government will replace that law.
In October 2009, the final version of GEMIX report commissioned by Minister Paul Magnette was published. The report studied the energy sources for the years 2020 and 2030. It recommended not to close the old nuclear reactors in 2015 as previously planned. Ecolo the French speaking green party was against keeping them after 2015.
As of November 2009, the plants may work till 2025, and GDF Suez may pay over 200 million a year to the Belgian government.
In 2000, Gas was used for producing 23.07% of the 78,85 TWh of electricity produced domestically 
As of 2006, gas thermal plants produces about 25% of Belgium electricity.
Here is a list of some location of plants (some are in construction): Drogenbos, Amercoeur, Tessenderlo. Building permits are processed for plants in Seneffe and Vise,
In 2000, coal was used for producing 14.25% of the 78,85 TWh of electricity produced domestically 
As of 2006, about 10% of electricity comes from coal.
In 2000, oil was used for producing 1.41% of the 78,85 TWh of electricity produced domestically 
In 2000, waste was used for producing 0.71% of the 78,85 TWh of electricity produced domestically 
In 2000, renewable energy was used for producing 0.71% of the 78,85 TWh of electricity produced domestically 
According to the GEMIX report, published on 9 October 2009 and commissioned by the Minister Paul Magnette, the off-shore wind potential is 17 TWh per year. Edora, the union of renewable energy producers in Wallonia refers to studies claiming that 7.8 TWh may come from renewable in 2015.
Currently there are more than 200 onshore wind turbines throughout Belgium, having a capacity of nearly 300 MW (170 MW in the Flemish Region and 130 MW in the Walloon Region).
 That day, Flemish onshore production was 235 MW, Flemish offshore production 30 MW and Walloon production was 279 MW.
Several large-scale offshore wind farms are being built off the Belgian coast : Thorntonbank Wind Farm (300 MW), Belwind Wind Farm (330 MW), Eldepasco (216 MW) and North of Bligh Bank (600 MW).
The number of solar power installations increased four times, it went from 16 000 at the end of 2008 to 65 000 at the end of 2009. At the end of 2009, the installed power was about 220 MW 
As of December 2009, there were 35,500 solar power installation in the Flemish region. The Vreg expected that it will reach 50,000 at the end of 2009.
Installed capacity of solar power has increased enormously since 2007. 
As of 30 September 2009, in the Flemish region, there were 35 444 installations that received green certificates for   In 2008, there were 12 703 installations in the Flemish region http://www.livios.be/nl/_build/_newz/_hot/9345.asp?content=Recordaantal%20nieuwe%20zonnepanelen
In October 2009, the city of Antwerp announced that they want to install 2,500 m   of solar panels on roofs of public buildings, that will be worth 265,000 kwh per annum.
In 2009, the city of Leuven has installed 1,810 solar panels on public buildings.
In December 2009, Katoen Natie announced that they will install 800,000 m   of solar panels in various places, including Antwerp. It is expected that the installed solar power in the Flemish Region will be increased by 25%, when finished. That will be the largest installation in Europe. The total cost will be 166 million euros. The installation produces about 35 GWh yearly.
In 2011, it became clear that Flemish subsidies for solar panels were too high, and people without solar panels would have to pay a higher electricity bill (up to     148 extra) to pay for those subsidies. Flemish minister for Energy Freya van den Bossche admitted that subsidies were too high, especially for large-scale installations.
As of 2009, there was 3.3% of electricity coming from renewable energy
The Flemish Region published various ''Beleidsnota energie''. The 2004-2009 version was published by Minister Kris Peeters. The 2004-2009 version was published by Minister  Freya Van den Bossche,on 27 October 2009. This report was partially based on research conducted by VITO. 
The Flemish region stated five goals for the government of 2009-2014:http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/beleid/beleidsnota_energie_2009-2014.pdf , page 25 
The government wants to have 9% of electricity coming from renewable in 2014 and 13% in 2020.
In the Brussels-Capital Region, the electricity and gaz net are operated by Sibelga. In 2008, the gas consumption was 10,511,433 MWh and the electricity consumption was 5,261,799 MWh. The electricitity consumption by municipality is given in the next table.
As of 2009, there were CHP for 25 MWe. In 2008, Sibelga gave subsidies for a total output of 18.3 MWe an 20 MWth. The total electric output in 2008, for these CHP installations was 611.6 MWhe.
The Region of Brussels-Capital has also implemented the European directive of 2002/91/CE on Energy Performance of Buildings.
