Can someone extend the red line to the interchange with US 180 and slap a NM 78 shield on the line? ( ) --  ( ) 18:00, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
I would like to nip a problem before it happens. Can I have the small inset map on   replaced with a zoomed out US Map with a dot where the Wendovers are? --  ( ) 06:49, 14 December 2010 (UTC)
Would it be possible to get a map for this cross-state GA? --  ( ) 21:07, 26 January 2011 (UTC)
Does anybody have/know of an interstate map for the state of Ohio that I can use? I am trying to promote List of Interstate Highways in Ohio to Featured List status, and it would be nice to have a labeled interstate map to put at the top. Thanks!   ( ) 14:05, 20 January 2011 (UTC)
The map needs to be updated to reflect the extension of the route. '''   ''' 01:46, 7 December 2010 (UTC)
So with the  , the southern end of the red line should terminate further north at SR-48 (where the southernmost orange line intersects along the red line).   (      )     03:50, 21 January 2011 (UTC)
NY 878 is actually one segment from NY 27 to it's current terminal in Long Beach. State Route 878 uses Rockaway Boulevard in between the two segments that are shown, so it's really only one segment.                                                                                      M3 via Park Avenue 21:36, 1 February 2011 (UTC)
For now the map is quite small and doesn't really show the route well. I'm nominating it for ACR (where it will likely fail, but anyhow) and would like a map that is slightly zoomed in to see the route more clearly. --'''   ''' 02:10, 3 February 2011 (UTC)
Can someone touch up the map re: Fredddie's concerns at the  ? --'''  ''' 22:44, 5 February 2011 (UTC)
The current map shown has US 264 eastern terminus at Whale Junction, but it is actually at Manns Harbor, North Carolina (a reduction of 11 miles).  Here is the  , via Google Maps, of US 264; there might be other changes, but those are not as noticeable as the eastern terminus. Thanks!  --  ( ) 00:06, 11 February 2011 (UTC)
I need maps for several Abilene area highways. They are FM 3438, UR 3438, and FM 89. They are not high priority, but they would be nice. Thanks!   ( ) 21:24, 26 April 2008 (UTC)
