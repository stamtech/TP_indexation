On November 6, 1905, the Los Angeles Interurban Railway started service on the ''Santa Ana Line''. It ran along an almost perfectly straight line between Watts(Los Angeles) and Santa Ana. Access to transportation allowed the population of the rural area which is now Stanton and West Anaheim to grow. In 1908, the privately owned Pacific Electric Railway leased the Santa Ana Line and took over the service which extended its regional light-rail system. By 1928, the impressive thousand mile system allowed residents convenient travel throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties.  The passenger service to Santa Ana was discontinued in 1950, shortly after the railway was taken over by the Metropolitan Transportation Agency. The easement still runs through town and is empty or used for parking. It intersects Beach/Pacific and Cerritos/Western.

The area was incorporated into the first City of Stanton in 1911. It was decided to disincorporate in 1924. The motivation for giving up cityhood seems to be that it would relieve city taxpayers from the financial burden of building roads. As an un-incorporated area, roads were paid for by the state. Also the main motivation for the 1911 incorporation     the city of Anaheim's 1911 plan to build a    sewage farm    west if their city     was no longer relevant. The costs of cityhood were greater than the benefit.
In the early 1950s, the area had experienced a post-war population boom, and in May 1956 the citizens decided to incorporate into today   s City of Stanton. The first city was around , and today's Stanton is a bit over three square miles. The cost of being incorporated into a city is still a salient issue in this part of the county. There are many small areas around Stanton which are un-incorporated and receive their services from the County of Orange.
The City of Stanton mitigates the high costs of cityhood for a relatively small population by contracting out municipal services. Most of the police services and fire protection are provided by the Orange County   s Sheriff   s Department and Orange County Fire Authority respectively. Ambulance service is provided by a private company, Care Ambulance Service. Stanton had formed its own police department when the city incorporated in 1956, but a union strike citing poor working conditions was originally reported as the major cause of its disbanding (and takeover by the Sheriff's Department) in 1988.
Management of the city and coordination of city services are provided by:
Fire protection in Stanton is provided by the Orange County Fire Authority with ambulance transport by Care Ambulance Service. The Orange County Sheriff's Department provides law enforcement. The city is a safe place to do business or live in as it has a crime rate that is about the same as the rest of Orange County, and significantly less than the rest of California. Currently, the residents are working with the Department to reduce quality of life crimes such as graffiti and illegal dumping.
In the state legislature Stanton is located in the 34th Senate District, represented by Democrat Lou Correa, and in the 67th and 68th Assembly District, represented by Republicans Jim Silva and Van Tran respectively.

The city hosts three major community events each year: Summerfest, a Halloween Fair, and Christmas in the City. All three events are well attended and cater to families with younger children. Summerfest typically includes carnival type rides, live music, food booths, and informational tables from community groups. The Halloween Fair features free games that children play for candy prizes, costume contests, and a DJ. Christmas in the City, also known in recent years as Snow Day, features several tons of man-made snow and a visit from Santa. Additionally, the Lions and Kiwanis Clubs typically serve a pancake breakfast or a pasta dinner, and the city has its official tree lighting.
Youth sports have been an integral part of the community since Stanton was a rural community. In the 1950s, with help of the  James Irvine Foundation, the Stanton Lions Club and a generous donation of land from farmer Al Stock, the community built ''Lions-Stock Park'' which had a sports facility and community center. This privately-owned park was later purchased by the school board. Today, Stanton youth participate in Pop Warner Football and the Stanton Little League.
