An ardent Liverpool fan, Nick moved to the United States in 1979, where he soon joined in the United States Army. He met Steven Cohen, his co-host, in the radio business while working in corporate marketing. In addition to hosting ''World Soccer Daily'', Geber and Cohen hosted ''Fox Football Fone-in'' (formerly ''Fox Football Friday''), a viewer-interactive television show on Fox Soccer Channel which roughly follows the format of ''WSD''.  
Nick recently left ''WSD'' in order to pursue poker on a full time basis, but plans to return occasionally as a guest host. Howard Rogers took his place, while FSC analyst Nick Webster replaced Geber on ''Fox Football Fone-in''. He is also the voice of the World Series of Poker Circuit and was the announcer for the Aruba Poker Classic as well as the Asian Pacific Poker Tour (APPT) Sydney Grand Final and the APPT Tournament of Champions. He will co-host World Series of Poker Radio in 2008. He will also be a lead announcer alongside ''Howard David'' at the upcoming 39th Annual World Series of Poker.
Nick also hosts the Bluff Magazine show ''Poker Night Radio'' on Sirius, and broadcasts from the World Series of Poker.
Nick was the voice of the 2008 World Series of Poker and World Series of Poker Europe on ESPN360
