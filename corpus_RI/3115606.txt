London-based '''Espotting''' Media was founded in 2000. Along with Goto.com (then Overture, now Yahoo! Search Marketing) it was a pioneer of pay per click advertising on web search engines.
European expansion paid off and revenues soared from just     80,000 in 2001 to     41 million in 2003.
Although successful, espotting did not have a strong partnership with any of the dominant search engines.  When Google and Yahoo! started to dominate the market place, espotting merged with US company FindWhat.com in 2004.
The merged company soon re-branded as MIVA, Inc. in 2005. 
In 2009 MIVA, Inc. sold its MIVA Media ad network division to Adknowledge. As a result of this sale MIVA, Inc. rebranded to Vertro, and its MIVA Direct division rebranded to alot.com.
