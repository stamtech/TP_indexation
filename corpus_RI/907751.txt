Jimenez first played on the European Tour in 1988 and improved steadily over the next few seasons. His first win on the tour came at the Piaget Belgian Open in 1992. During a fairly up and down career, he has so far had four main periods of success. In 1994 he finished fifth on the European Tour Order of Merit. One highlight was scoring an exceptionally rare albatross (double eagle) on the 17th hole at Valderrama, during the 1994 Volvo Masters, sinking his second shot on the par-5 hole with a 3-iron.
After some weaker seasons he bounced back in 1998 and 1999, finishing fourth on the Order of Merit in consecutive years and winning four tournaments including the prestigious Volvo Masters. In 1999 he also came second in the WGC-American Express Championship, which is one of the elite World Golf Championships events, and made his Ryder Cup debut.
In 2004 he once again bounced back from some modest seasons, notching up another fourth place finish on the Order of Merit, and winning four European Tour events, which was more than any other player. He maintained his form into 2005, winning the Omega Hong Kong Open, which is a European Tour event, and the Celtic Manor Wales Open. He has featured in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Jimenez has had great success in team events representing Europe and Spain, winning the Alfred Dunhill Cup in 1999 and 2000, the Seve Trophy in 2000 and the Ryder Cup in 2004 and 2010.
In 2005 he won the Spanish Pairs final, with Andres Jimenez at La Cala Resort in Andalucia, Spain.
2008 proved to be another good season with two wins, earning Jimenez a spot on the 2008 Ryder Cup team. He finished the season ranked fourth on the Order of Merit once more.
While defending his BMW PGA Championship title in 2009, Jimenez scored a rare albatross (double eagle) by holing a 206-yard six-iron on his second shot on the par-five fourth. It was the second such feat of his competitive career.
In February 2010, Jimenez won the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, beating Lee Westwood in a playoff and in July added the Alstom Open de France, beating Alejandro Canizares and Francesco Molinari on the first hole of a playoff. He won his third event of the year at the Omega European Masters, finishing three strokes ahead of Edoardo Molinari
He is known as "The Mechanic" for his preference for repairing, rather than driving, high performance vehicles, especially his red Ferrari.
