Before embarking on his poker career, Cernuto graduated Florida State University as a finance major. After graduating he worked as an air traffic controller. When Ronald Reagan fired the air traffic controllers during a 1981 strike, he turned to poker for his profession.

Another five WSOP money finishes followed before he won his first bracelet in the 1996 WSOP $1,500 seven card stud split tournament. He also won the $2,000 no limit hold'em event in the 1997 World Series of Poker and the $1,500 limit omaha event in the  2002 World Series of Poker.
