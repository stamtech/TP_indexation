Like most areas of New England, Orange County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory.  
There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont: towns, cities and villages.  As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government.  Cities are independent of and equivalent to towns, but differ in their form of government.  Villages overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries.  Incorporated villages are not found in any of the other New England states, and are less common in Vermont today than they have been in the past.  A number of villages have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert back to full town control; most of those that remain are very small.  
The main tables below show municipalities at the town level.  For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality should yield the county total.  The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; however, there have never been any cities in Orange County.  A separate section follows with population totals for villages from 1930 to 2000.

This section lists census totals for incorporated villages for 1930 through 2000.
As of 1930, Orange County contained four incorporated villages:
The village of Randolph disincorporated in 1985, and the village of Bradford disincorporated in 2004.
Note: The population of the village of Newbury was not reported separately from the town of Newbury in the 1950 and 1960 Censuses; it is not clear why.
As had been the case with the 1950 and 1960 Censuses, the 1970 Census did not initially report the population for the village of Newbury separately from the town of Newbury. The inclusion of a total for the village of Newbury was a later revision. The village of Jericho, in Chittenden County, and the borough of Woodmont, Connecticut follow similar patterns.
The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 2000 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 2000 total for the town of Newbury was originally reported as 1,955; and for the town of Chelsea, 1,250. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above.  As part of the revision, the population of the village of Newbury was also revised; it was originally reported as 396.  This was apparently done to correct an assignment error between the two towns, which affected the village on the Newbury side; the collective population of the two towns is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.
