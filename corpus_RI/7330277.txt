Leapfish concentrates on providing a single, connected, multi-media experience for both searching and sharing traditional and real-time content in order to make the new web more integrated for users. The company promotes the idea of "Living The Web" and being able to view all the Internet sources in one place.
Leapfish launched in November 2008 and incorporated the top three search engines (Google, Yahoo!, Live Search) as well as other tools like YouTube, Amazon, and Yahoo! Answers. LeapFish also introduced a click-free search technology, which gives users results as the keyword is typed in. 
Leapfish launched its current version in November 2009.  The update includes features such as traditional and real-time search, a customizable homepage, interactive widgets, and social media integration.
One of LeapFish's advertising programs allows business owners to display a permanent advertisement on the top of the search results page.  The ad space is granted by purchasing a keyword of the advertiser's choice.
In addition to its search tools. LeapFish also provides domain appraisals complimented with a scoring system via their own proprietary algorithm. In addition to appraisal values, LeapFish provides Domain Information such as Traffic Rankings and Unique Visitors from Compete.com.
The new leapfish.com has had a mixed reception from users of sitepoint forums, from bloggers and other regular web users.
On February 3, 2009 the online blog TechCrunch posted evidence of LeapFish sales representatives intentionally abusing the Google's pay-per-click model against potential customers.. The CEO of LeapFish's parent company, DotNext, confirmed the sales representative's actions, but announced that the representative was no longer employed by the company.
The company has also been accused of astroturfing (Note, in particular, the comment from Robin Wauters on November 20, 2008 at 12:57 pm PST), and spamming.
As opposed to other Search Engines, such as Google or Yahoo which appear to favour web based sales, Leapfish keywords are largely sold via an aggressive telemarketing operation which has not been without friction with the online community. The telemarketing team consists of 80 sales persons.
