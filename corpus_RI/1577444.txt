The AW70 was a 4 speed fully automatic transmission used in the Volvo 240, 740 and 940 series cars starting from 1984 up to 1997 with the end of production of the 940. From the 1989 model year a lock-up torque converter was offered which changed the designation to AW70L.
The AW71 and AW71L was a strengthened version of the AW70 transmission used in the Volvo 760, 260, 940 and some 740s and 240s with higher powered engines.
An automatic gearbox built by Aisin of Japan used the Volvo 16-valve B234F 4-cylinder engine found in the 740 GLE. This gearbox is a modified AW71 with different ratios to leverage the unique power curve characteristics produced by the 16-valve head (when compared to the 8-valve B230F/FT with an AW71 gearbox). Some of the B234F-equipped 740's came with a ZF-made gearbox (designated by a gearshift labeled "P R N D 3 2 1"). The AW72 (gearshift labeled "P R N D 2 1" with a side-mounted overdrive lockout) is widely considered significantly more reliable than the ZF transmission.
