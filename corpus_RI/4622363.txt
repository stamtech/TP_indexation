Warren's previous clubs include Wrexham FC and Cobh Ramblers. Warren also once scored a double hat trick in a league match for Cobh Ramblers.
Warren took his first football steps with local club Mayfield United as a stylish central midfielder. He was quickly spotted and was part of the Republic of Ireland Under 16 squad that won the UEFA Under-16 Championships in 1998.
In 2000, he moved to Welsh side Wrexham but after two frustrating seasons during which he made just six League appearances for The Robins. The financial troubles that beset the Football League meant that Warren was released by Wrexham in 2002 and he returned to his hometown club Cork City along with the likes of George O'Callaghan and John O'Flynn.
At Turner's Cross, Warren struggled for form and moved on loan to Cobh . There he impressed under then-manager Dave Hill who made the move to St Colman's Park permanent. After a successful spell at Cobh , Warren moved to League of Ireland Premier Division side Waterford United in 2007.
Warren scored  nine goals in four matches during October 2004, including six goals in an 8-1 victory over Monaghan United. A new First Division record, Warren is only the third player to score six goals in one League match in the last 50 years. Jonathan Speak (Derry City) and Brendan Bradley (Finn Harps) are the other two to have managed such an achievement, but Warren believes that he could have scored more and broken the overall League record held by Jimmy Munroe who scored seven goals for Cork against St James's Gate in 1931.
In March, Warren signed for Cork City, but he was released in July after just 7 league appearances.
