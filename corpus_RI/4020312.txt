Can people tell where I live just by my IP address? Is there a list on Wikipedia that shows the IP addresses for different countries? --  02:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
Yes! It does! Thanks! :) How could you tell? Is 124 the number for Melbourne or something? --  04:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
Anyone who is knowledgeable in electronics or electrical engineering will find this question incredibly stupid, but for the initiate, this is really a mystery. I have a box filled with close to 100 electronic devices with varying degrees of functionality. This box also contains a similar number of AC-DC adapters for those devices. Almost every single adapter's supplied power is different, and to a lesser extent, the plugs. 
What I need to know is: How is it determined what voltage and amperage these adapters need to supply? Also, why are all these devices power requirements so vastly different when their design is so similar?
To further clarify my question, let me list are a few examples: 
Example #1: Identical Items. I have two Linksys WRT54G consumer routers, exact same model, different revisions (1.0 and 1.1, I think) The v1.0 router's AC adapter outputs 5V, 2.0A, while the v1.1 adapter is 12V, 1000mA. Why did the later model jump to 12V, while the supplied Amps dropped by half?
Example #2, Rechargeable items. First is a rechargeable toothbrush. Its charging adapter outputs 1.45V, 120mA. Compare that to a much smaller Sanyo cell phone AC adapter that outputs a (relatively) much higher 5.4V 900mA! Both use the same type of battery (Ni-Cd), and the cell phone's battery is 1/4 the size of the toothbrush's battery. Why does this cell phone require more power to charge than the previously mentioned router? 
Example #3. Seemingly Backward Power Usage. First is a Sony digital answering machine, with lots of LEDs and a bright screen. Its AC adapter outputs 12V, 200mA. Second is a Panasonic of similar size with no LEDs and no screen. Its adapter outputs 12V, 1200mA - Why so different? I've taken them apart, and aside from the LEDs and screen, the components are practically identical in size and quantity.
I just don't get why one item would require 4.5V, 1500mA, and another would use 12V, 200mA. Why couldn't it use 6V, 400mA, or any other combination of the two?
Thanks in advance for any non-ridiculing answers. This has bothered me for years. I've read tons of material on electronics, and so far, haven't found an answer that made sense to me yet.   10:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
Hello
I hope you can help me.  I am doing research and I am having a problem.  I

Quite a while back I heard the (in my opinion classic) clip of a Australian(?) radio contest where a man had to spell AC/DC. I can't find this now, but I have a great desire to find it again. Could someone please point me in the right direction? Thanks   09:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
Would it be possible to work out how big a nuke was after it had exploded? If you look at a crater, can you find out either how big it was, or how big the explosion was, if you couldn't measure it before the explosion, such as the 1908 disaster :?   19:38, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
So, my band and I have played a few gigs and have a demo CD, the next stp is for us to get sponsored, and have a five album deal.  How would one go about this? Send our demo to EMI/Sony/Geffen, and say what? Give us money? Thanks.
Oh and further more, how would one go about copyrighting our songs so the record company doesn't steal em thanks  16:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

Higher up in the Reference desk is a question about the Highway code and how to deal with crossroads when 2 people are on opposing sides. This is the somewhat cryptic reply to the email I sent to the highways authority...
To summarize they seem to be pointing out that "the highway code do not give you the right of way in any circumstance, but they advise you when you should give way to others. Always give way if it can help avoid an accident". I think this basically means there is no hard-fast rule. It would seem most sensible to me that the user 'crossing' the road is given priority from a 'safety' point of view as theirs is the most dangerous of manouveres, whilst the person turning onto the main-road is at least joining the flow of traffic. Entirely personal interpretation but there you go. Kinda hoped the answer from the highway code would be more final but that's the official advice.   17:57, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
I can't feel my heart or my pulse. What should I do?
Have you tried feeling it in your throat? I can't feel my pulse in my wrist, but find it easily in other places :) Also you could try running a lot before you try to find it :) Or maybe you just have very low blood pressure :( You can find out by running up lots of stairs- if it feels like your head is spinning in three directions at the same time as is about to explode, you might have low blood pressure :(   18:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
Also you shouldn't be able to feel your heart :) I can sometimes, but then I might have Green Sickness, so if you can't feel your actual heart beating that is usually a good thing :)   18:51, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

And when you walk along the beach and there's no footprints behind you, that is rather disconcerting too     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 
That's funny -- I can't feel your heart or your pulse either.   In all probability, and armed with nothing but logic, brash confidence, and a netfull of biases, I am forced to conclude that one of us is dead.   
There's no always something wrong with a very high number :) One time I counted nearly 500 beats per minuite, but it turned out, since I was counting the number of times my heart was beating instead of my pulse it was only about 230 :)   12:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
This is probably not a good place to ask this, but I will anyway. I suppose i could just delete it if everyone complains, but anyway... What I wanted to ask was what people here thought I should do. Do you think I should go away and give up answering questions here? Or do you want me to make less rubbish jokes? Of course this should probably go on my talk page or somewhere, but does anyone ever read them? Thanks for any help:   19:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
And try to be honest, I don't mind :)   19:21, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
I've always gone with the wit!  Too be sure, you can look at my talk page, and see the complaints from 'serious' people, but they always seem to die sooner or later, of their own intensity... --  20:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
