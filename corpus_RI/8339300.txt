TV-SAT 1 was launched by Arianespace using an Ariane 2 rocket flying from ELA-1 at Kourou. The launch took place at 02:19:00 GMT on 21 November 1987. It was the first Spacebus 300 satellite to be launched. Immediately after launch, one of its solar panels failed to deploy, and as a result of this the main uplink antenna, which was located behind the solar panel, could not deploy either. This failure was later established to have been the result of two hold-down bolts, which should have been removed prior to launch, being left on the satellite.
Despite the failure, TVSAT-1 was placed into a geosynchronous orbit at a longitude of 19.2   West. It was briefly used for a series of tests to verify the satellite's systems, before it was retired to a graveyard orbit.
TV-Sat 2 followed on 8 August 1989.
