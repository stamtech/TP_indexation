Wilsgaard's father was a Norwegian sailor. During World War II, the family fled from Norway to Sweden.
As Chief Designer, Wilsgaard designed all Volvo's projects during his tenure, with few exceptions (e.g., the Volvo P1900 Sport and P1800 Coupe). One of Wilsgaard's first jobs was to design better rear windows for the PV Duett Van, a prophetic project, given that Wilsgaard went on to design the estate versions of the company's Amazon, 145, 760 and 850 Series &mdash; during a period which saw Volvo become closely associated with the station wagon / estate body type.
In addition to designing the Amazon, and 144, Wilsgaard also designed the highly regarded Volvo 164, as well as his successful estate adaptation, the 1800ES, of the company's P1800 Coupe.  According to Simon Lamarre, chief studio designer, "the 1800ES has become one of the icons for Volvo," 
When he designed the Volvo 140 Series,
Wilsgaard lives today in Gothenburg, Sweden.
