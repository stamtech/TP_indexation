This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System.
Starting at Finley Avenue on Newport Boulevard in Newport Beach,  south of SR 1, Route 55/Newport Boulevard is a 4-lane expressway for approximately three-quarters of a mile to its intersection with 17th Street in Costa Mesa.  It then follows a traditional street routing through a retail and commercial section of Costa Mesa until its intersection with 19th Street.  Following the 19th Street intersection, Route 55 becomes an eight-lane below-grade freeway that bisects the northbound and southbound lanes of Newport Boulevard until the Mesa Drive undercrossing. North of Fair Drive, Route 55 is an at-grade or above-grade freeway, with the exception of a one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) stretch between the 1st Street/4th Street exit and the 17th Street exit in Santa Ana which is below-grade.
The segment on Newport Boulevard includes a limited-access interchange at SR 1. The southbound side of the Costa Mesa Freeway does not have a direct link to northbound Interstate 5, the Santa Ana Freeway. Route 55 is known to be crowded due to it being the primary free link from job centers in Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa to SR 91, which leads to commuter communities of the Inland Empire and other places northeast of Orange County. 
SR 55 was the first freeway in Orange County to receive carpool lanes,  opened in 1985. The stretch of the 55 between Fair Dr. and 19th Street in Costa Mesa was opened in 1990; plans to extend the 55 freeway south from 19th Street to State Route 1 were never realized, but in April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps.
Route 55 from Route 91 to Costa Mesa is known as the Costa Mesa Freeway, as named by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 177, Chapter 86 in 1976.
Route 55 was originally built in 1931 and was originally numbered as Route 43.  It was built from the southern terminus of SR 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway, or "PCH") and continued northbound on the same route it follows today, through the cities of Newport Beach, Tustin, Costa Mesa, and Anaheim, and then went eastward through Riverside on what is known today as Route 91 to link with Interstate 215.  In 1959 the freeway was renumbered as Route 55, and its route was shortened from Route 1 to the also-renumbered Route 91.
Today, Route 55 is a heavily-travelled corridor linking southern Orange County with Route 91, the main corridor between the Inland Empire and the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, as well as Interstate 5, the main north&ndash;south corridor for California.  A HOV lane has been built along the entire route, with its own off- and on-ramps.  However, congestion is still very prevalent throughout the day, as is the norm with many Orange County freeways; Route 55 experiences a peak daily traffic volume of 262,000 vehicles and 17,292 trucks.http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/traffops/saferesr/trafdata/truck2005final.pdf
The entire freeway section of Route 55, approximately , is called the Costa Mesa Freeway.  It was formerly called the Newport Freeway, with the name being changed by the legislature in 1976.  Caltrans did not begin changing signs to reflect the name change until the early 1990s. In 2010, the stretch between Chapman and Katella avenues in the City of Orange was renamed the '''Paul Johnson Freeway''' for longtime local radio television traffic reporter Paul Johnson, who died the same year.
The entire route is in Orange County.
