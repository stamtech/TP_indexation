The '''246, 311, 311A, 313, 313A, 313E & 399''' are seven bus routes running in West Midlands, England. The 246, 311, 311A, 313 & 313A are operated by National Express West Midlands, whilst Diamond Bus operates the 313E & 399.
Currently, on a Monday - Saturday daytime, National Express West Midlands operates the '''311'''  and '''313''' (Walsall - Dudley services) to a combined 7/8 minute Monday - Saturday daytime frequency.
Previously, both the 311 and 313 continued to Stourbridge. The 313 was shortened in 2003, being replaced in 2006 by the '''246''' between Dudley and Stourbridge, whilst the 311 was shortened in November 2009, due to major roadworks in the Dudley area causing reliability issues. The 246's frequency was then doubled to every 7/8 minutes, with the introduction of a half-hourly evening service and a twenty minute Sunday daytime service.
The '''313A''' meanwhile is operated by National Express West Midlands between Dudley and Walsall only, operating three am peak workings Monday - Friday.
The '''399''' runs to an hourly frequency between Walsall and Wednesbury by Diamond Bus, during Monday - Saturday daytimes. Diamond Bus uses a specially IKEA branded bus on this service.
During Monday - Saturday evenings, National Express West Midlands operates the '''311A''', which was previously numbered the 312. This is a service which follows a mixture of the 311 and 313 routes between Walsall and Dudley and runs to an hourly frequency, combined with the 311 to give a half hourly frequency.
Additionally, a shortened working of the 313, the 313E, also operates to an hourly frequency during evenings, by Diamond Busbetween Dudley and Wednesbury.
Sunday services are very similar to evening services in frequency throughout the whole day, however, service 313E only runs during the evening, as per any other day.
National Express West Midlands operates the 311/A and 313/A from its Walsall Garage using brand new Scania OmniLinks with a seating capacity of 43. The OmniLinks replaced just two year old Volvo B7RLE Wright Eclipse Gemini buses on the route, which had a similar seating capacity. The 246 meanwhile is operated from the companies Pensnett Garage and is therefore operated using a mixture of Volvo B10L (Wright Liberator) and occasional Volvo B6LE (Wright Crusader) single deck buses.
Diamond Bus uses Dennis Darts on its services.
