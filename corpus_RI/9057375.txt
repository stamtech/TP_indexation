Solow was one of the earliest supporters and financial backers of President Barack Obama, since his 1994 campaign for the Illinois State Senate, including an interview to ''The Forward'' praising Obama's abilities.  At the time, Solow resided in Obama's South Side of Chicago district. This support continued with the Senate campaign and played an important role in the Presidential campaign, helping gather Jewish support for the candidate.  He was also one of the bundlers (major financial backers) of the Obama campaign, having contributed over half a million dollars.
Solow is credited with calling Barack Obama "the first Jewish president". In 2008, he was quoted: "I said with a smile that he will be the first Jewish president. He also has a deep understanding of issues that confront Israel and the Jewish community."  He also traveled with Obama to Israel in a highly publicized visit in 2007.
It is widely speculated that the friendship with the president helped Solow become the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a suggestion rejected by Solow. Later, Solow criticized the Obama administration for its stand on the Israeli settlements issue. He also criticized Obama anti-semitism envoy Hannah Rosenthal for remarks which "could threaten to limit her effectiveness in the area for which she is actually responsible".
