The '''Wright Fusion''' is a low floor articulated single-deck bus body built by Wright on Volvo B10LA chassis. It was the articulated version of the Wright Liberator.
The only customer for the Fusion was FirstGroup for its Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow subsidiaries. A total of forty were built in 1998 and 1999.
More recent articulated models have also used the Fusion name, but in conjunction with the name of the equivalent rigid single-decker. These are the Solar Fusion on Scania L94UA chassis, and the Eclipse Fusion on Volvo B7LA.
