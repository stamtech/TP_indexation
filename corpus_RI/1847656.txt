Lisandro has not yet made a final table on the World Poker Tour (WPT), but has finished in the money in two events.
In December 2004, Lisandro won the $25,000 limit hold'em heads-up tournament, defeating Howard Lederer in the final to take home the $194,000 grand prize.
In May 2005, he won the $10,000 no limit hold'em World Series of Poker circuit event at Lake Tahoe, defeating Phil Ivey in the final heads-up confrontation to win the $542,360 prize. Lisandro has said that he considers this to be one of his greatest achievements, as he rates Ivey to be one of the best players in the world.
Lisandro finished 17th in the 2006 World Series of Poker main event, winning $659,730.  He was also noted for an incident with Prahlad Friedman during the event, where Friedman felt that Lisandro had not put in his ante, worth 5,000 chips, in a hand. (In posting one of the blinds, a third player at the table forgot to put in ''his'' ante; the dealer corrected his mistake.)  Friedman brought it up constantly through the hand, with the dealer telling him to stop bringing it up.  Friedman would not stop, and called Lisandro a "thief".  Lisandro was very upset to hear that, and argued with Friedman, telling him he would "take his head off".  Friedman tried to settle things with Lisandro afterwards during play, but Lisandro refused to talk to him. However, their attempt to reconcile did have one light moment after a player at their table, after learning that Lisandro was from Italy, told Jeff that his wife was also from Italy and that he and his wife planned to travel there to visit her parents. Lisandro asked him, "Can you take him (Friedman) with you?"
He won his first World Series of Poker bracelet in 2007 in the $2,000 Seven-Card Stud event beating a final table that included Daniel Negreanu and Nick Frangos.
