The '''Volvo TR670 Series''' was a taxicab manufactured by Volvo between 1930 and 1937. The model name stands for '''TR'''afikvagn ("taxicab"), 6 cylinders, 7 seats; the third digit indicates the version.
With the introduction of the six cylinder PV650 Series in 1929, Volvo had a car large and robust enough to be competitive on the lucrative taxicab market. The TR670 Series was introduced in February 1930. Volvo increased the wheelbase by 150&nbsp;mm (to 3,100&nbsp;mm), which turned the car into a seven seater with two foldable spare seats in the passenger compartment. The car was built in two versions: the '''TR S''' ('''S'''tad,    town   ) had a glass partition between the driver and the passenger seats. This car also had a higher roof line, so that the gentlemen woldn   t have to take of their top hats during the ride. The '''TR L''' ('''L'''andsort,    countryside   ) lacked the partition and used the same roof line as the ordinary PV651. The model names where soon altered to '''TR671''' and '''TR672''', in line with the PV650/PV651/PV652 nomenclature.Lindh, ''Volvo: The Cars'', p. 36 As with the PV650 Series, there were also commercial chassis versions of the car.
The cars where succeeded in the spring of 1931 by the '''TR673''' and '''TR674'''. These new cars had longer and wider bodies, to increase the passenger space.
In January 1932 the taxicabs were updated with the larger capacity 3,366&nbsp;cc '''EB''' engine and a new 3-speed gearbox with synchronized 2nd and 3rd gear.
Total production of TR671/672: 200 cars
In April 1934 the taxicabs were uppdated with a new, stronger chassis with an X-shaped cross member support, smaller 17&nbsp;inch rims and an all-steel body, without the wooden frame. The wheelbase was increased another 150&nbsp;mm, except for the town car which kept the smaller wheelbase and the higher roof line.
In 1935 Volvo updated the taxicabs once more. The cars got the larger capacity 3670cc EC engine and a V-shaped radiator grille.
The TR670 Series was superseded by the Volvo PV800 Series in 1937.
