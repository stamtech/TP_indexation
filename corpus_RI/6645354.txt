At the 1973 World Series of Poker, Angel won the $1,000 buy-in WSOP Razz event, with its $32,000 prize and bracelet.  In 1975, he won a second bracelet and $17,000 in the $1,000 buy-in Razz event.
Angel also won a Razz event at the 1981 Super Bowl of Poker, organized by 1972 world champion Amarillo Slim.  For this win, he received a prize of $57,000.  He also cashed in various other tournaments during his career, with tournament winnings over $180,000. 
In the 1950s, Angel worked as a driver for Nick "The Greek" Dandalos and began playing poker during this time.  He also would sometimes sell jewelry to raise extra money for his poker bankroll.  Despite his poker tournament success, Angel was primarily a cash game player during much of his poker career.
