His last name is from his Dutch father. His mother is Swedish. The family moved to Falkenberg when Martin was 5 and in 1992 Martin left to go to Stockholm and from there to Las Vegas where he currently lives.
Martin started playing poker aged 15 (mostly 5-card draw) but became fond of Omaha and Hold-Em when introduced to them. He considers Doyle Brunson's book ''Super System'' to be the best poker book ever written.
He first made a name for himself in the poker world with a 13th place finish in the 2002 World Series of Poker Main Event, earning himself $60,000.
Entering into the World Poker Tour, he finished 15th in the series 1 championship, winning $26,664; and went on to win the same tournament the following year, earning a then-record-breaking $2,728,356.
Less than a month later his success continued with a 2nd place finish in the $5,000 No Limit Hold-Em event at the 2004 World Series of Poker.
Martin wrote an article for ''Card Player'' magazine in 2005 encouraging tournament backers to reveal themselves. It was met with mixed reactions from poker professionals.
As of his last tournament cash in 2008, his total live tournament winnings exceed $3,370,000.
Outside of poker, Martin is an avid bridge player, having finished second in the Blue Ribbon Pairs, one of the two major North American pair bridge championships.
