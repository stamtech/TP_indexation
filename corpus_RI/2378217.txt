Leigh was introduced to poker by Robert Boyd (Dutch Boyd's brother) years after they met each other on Internet Relay Chat.
Leigh built up from playing $5 SNG online poker tournaments to playing $100/$200 limit hold'em cash games. She also cashed in the $1,000 limit hold'em event of the World Championship of Online Poker.
Leigh's nickname "Jennicide" was her alias on hacking bulletin boards when she was younger. She was at one time involved in beige boxing. (Leigh has described herself as a nerd, with knowledge of Linux and C# programming.)
Whilst Leigh is best known for playing online poker at PokerStars under the screen name "Jennicide," she was also involved in the   series. She won two preliminary heats and went on to finish 5th in the Grand Final. She  finished in the money in the World Poker Tour (WPT) 2006 Caribbean Poker Adventure.
Jennicide loves video games, and has blogged about reaching level 70 on ''World of Warcraft''.  She also played the MMORPG ''EverQuest'', and is now actively playing ''Aion''.
Leigh has also posed for ''FHM Online'' in 2007, and appeared in the May 2008 issue of ''Playboy''.
As of 2008, her live tournament winnings exceed $61,000.
