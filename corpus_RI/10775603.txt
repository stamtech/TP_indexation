I made a wikipedia page for Ilkka Saari has IMDb ranking around 100000, so I think it is worth a wikipedia page.
About 300000 to 1000000 people see the name Ilkka Saari annually so there might even be traffic into this page. Significant amount of those persons will search
I hope you notice that I am fighting for the rights of 7 million film industry people, and you should have clear guidelines of who can be in wikipedia by filmindustry rankings. So I hope you reassess this case and even factualize by your answer that there is an existing lack of guidelines
The list of film industry ranking / notability providers is very short; it is IMDb; which I have around top 100000. Develop clear guidelines of who can be in wikipedia for film industry people and judge me accordingly. This is what I ask of Wikipedia

I am truly amazed !!!!  Ilkka Saari is altogether another person !!!  Ilkka Saari in question is in IMDb Ilkka Saari II  and the person referred is Ilkka Saari III
John, I really hope there would be some logical reason on what you say !!!
How many Tom Johnsons there are in film industry ?   At least 38-
And each is treated individually
So John, you are clearly proving my fact of no knowledge of film industry which is my point !!!
What you are referring to can happen in music industry-      Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 14:52, 23 January 2011 (UTC) 
Quote from JohnCD "....and on "Bond#24", which must be some way off as Bond#23 is not yet released."
That script has been at least in consideration in Danjaq; but why would there be need blame that something is way off ? unless a mindless hunt is away ??? I don't have anything to hide-
What I would prefer to see is any reference to The Variety
Quote "None of the above indicates   by Wikipedia's standard" is purely disregarding and absurd
But John, we are learning, aren't we. Anybody connected with this case will learn a lot. And the next person will be treated correctly and justly.
Which Ilkka Saari II will never deserve, I presume      Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 15:19, 23 January 2011 (UTC) 
Original idea to the Matrix movie 1985 the name mathematical object of Matrix
1991 After studying philosophies of existence came with the idea that all visual etc sense input is given. Idea that humans are used for warmth ( used in first Matrix ) This is my statement I think , therefore I am - Ilkka Saari

And JohnCD, before you ask...   This issue with Matrix has been talked with VillageRoadhouse from the year 2005. 
No. It has not been in court, unlike one female Scifi writer who also claimed copying from a her book.
And the claim has been discussed with all Matrix actors, who said that they would not be all that surprised if that would happen
Note that it was not in the article, while the aim here is not to encyclopediaze anything already in CV, while it is far more important
So Matrix was chosen not to be presented in the article, while it could have been.
Then why is it mentioned here ? Merely to show you that with Ilkka Saari II we are talking about a very imaginative person
And Ilkka Saari II would really deserve a Wikipedia page, without a mention of Matrix, if so consensused
Quote : That is exactly my point. This discussion is about Ilkka Saari II. The question is, can we find any independent comments on him or his work, to show notability? One place to look is a News search, and that does find hits for the name, but they are all about the other one, the TV2 man. JohnCD (talk) 15:54, 23 January 2011 (UTC)
Reply:  Yes, News search does not show Ilkka Saari II, only Ilkka Saari III, but you can do google search and you will find Ilkka Saari II on top.
And you can do yahoo with Ilkka Saari II that would be purely Ilkka Saari II, but you did leave both google and yahoo out, while you were aware of them.
But the fact is that there are no news nor magazine articles. Few, but none to mention
And hopefully you have noticed that they have not been tried to be presented, as what is presented can be verified
JohnCD Almost afraid to ask...    but does not being on top of google searches, and exclusivity in yahoo searches tell Wikipedia something, moreso to news search ??  ( ) 16:19, 23 January 2011 (UTC)
