In early 1999, The Yahoo! counsel sent the creators of YaHooka a cease-and-desist letter, because the domain yahooka.com is similar to the domain yahoo.com.
Wired News ran a story entitled "":
On 9 January (1999), the creators of YaHooka received a sobering cease-and-desist letter from Yahoo counsel. The letter warned that if the unapologetically pro-pot site wasn't shut down by 12 January -- and the domain names yahooka.com and yahooka.net turned over to Yahoo -- the founders of YaHooka would face serious consequences, including a possible trademark infringement lawsuit and the payment of monetary damages.
A law firm representing Yahoo! sent a letter to the creators of Yahooka--which calls itself the "guide to marijuana on the Internet"--late last week, threatening legal action if the site is not deactivated and the domains "yahooka.com" and "yahooka.net" are not turned over to Yahoo. The letter gives a deadline of January 13 (1999) for "written assurances" of compliance.
The YaHooka server has been inaccessible several times over the course of its existence, the most recent time being from March 10, through March 12, 2007. It is not commonly known why this occurred, but no information on the main site or forums was lost. However, a server crash several years earlier resulted in the loss of large amounts of data. Information is needed pertaining to both of these instances.
