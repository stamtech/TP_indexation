The name Telebec originated with the first telephone company to operate a municipal system in the town of Becancour, "'''Tele'''phone '''Bec'''ancour", which was founded in 1965 by a group of businessmen. Three years later, Telebec merged with seven other phone companies: Telephone Princeville ltee, Telecommunication Richelieu ltee, Telephone de Contrecoeur ltee, Compagnie de Telephone La Tuque ltee, Telecommunications de l'Est ltee, Compagnie de Telephone Arthabaska ltee, and Compagnie de Telephone Pontiac ltee.
Other telephones companies were merged with Telebec and some of them were sold to Telebec over the years.
Currently, Telebec is the landline carrier for over 180,000 customers spread on about 750,000 square kilometres, making it the telephone company with the largest territory in Quebec.
In 1996 Telebec created Telebec Mobilite, a CDMA cell phone provider closely linked with Bell Mobility.
Telebec is also an ADSL, cable, satellite and DSL (fast, modem free, phone-line connection) Internet Service Provider (ISP) through Telebec Internet which is also closely linked with Bell Sympatico.
Since January 30, 2007, Telebec is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Aliant.
