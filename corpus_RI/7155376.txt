The National made their network television debut when they performed "Fake Empire" on ''The Late Show with David Letterman'' on July 24, 2007. In the television series ''Chuck'', the song appeared in the episode "Chuck Versus the Break-up" on October 13, 2008. "Fake Empire" also played during the final scene of the pilot episode of NBC's police drama ''Southland'', as well as over the concluding scene and credits of the 2008 film ''Battle in Seattle''. An instrumental version of the song was featured in Barack Obama's campaign video "Signs of Hope and Change" during his 2008 United States presidential campaign, and the song was also played at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. The members of The National supported the presidential candidate; they put Obama's face on a fundraising t-shirt with the text "Mr. November," taken from the name of a song from the band's third album, ''Alligator''. In the fifth season premiere episode of the teen drama television series ''One Tree Hill'', several songs by The National were featured, including "Fake Empire."
Allmusic considered "Fake Empire" one of The National's best songs, and described it as a song that "begins as a dead-of-night ballad that echoes Leonard Cohen, then peppy brass and guitars turn it into something joyous." Mark Mordue of ''WAToday'' called "Fake Empire" "one of the great rock'n'roll songs" of 2007. He described it as "a romantic-sounding tune marked by a quiet declaration that 'We're half awake in a fake empire,'  married the lonely-guy blues of a New York night to a veiled critique of American imperialism. In short, it expressed the feelings of being lost inside a dream." ''Stylus Magazine'' ranked "Fake Empire" as the 7th-best song of 2007.
Danny Seim of Menomena recorded a cover of the song in 2008 for his solo project, Lackthereof, on the album ''Your Anchor''.
