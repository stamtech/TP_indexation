The '''Noble M600''' is a handbuilt British supercar made by Noble Automotive in Leicestershire. It is made from stainless steel and carbon fibre and uses a twin turbocharged V8.
The Noble M600 is priced at around   200,000 in the UK.
The M600 engine uses a 4439 cc 60-degree Yamaha derived Volvo "B8444S" V8 engine which is also used in the Volvo XC90 but with twin Garrett turbochargers equipped with Variable Boost. This allows the user to choose from  (Road setting, 0.6 bar pressure),  (Track setting, 0.8 bar) and  (Race setting, 1.0 bar) through the use of a switch in the interior. The engine also features Electronic Fuel Injection and has a compression ratio of 9.50:1. It uses a Oerlikon Graziano transaxle six-speed Twin Clutch manual gearbox and has the RPM redline set at 7000.
The brakes, while servo assisted, are "barely" assisted and with no ABS it is very easy to lock the wheels. Also, according to motoring journalist John Barker, the door mirrors get in the way if one tries to look if anything is coming. He says, "The driver   s door mirror gets in the way looking into right-hand turns". It has very limited availability due to the fact that only 50 are made every year.
