The school is  in size, designed for an enrollment of 1,600 students. It is built for the smaller learning communities format, with four "houses". It was built in 2006 with $136 million in funding. The school is LEED Silver-certified; some environmentally-friendly features include waterless urinals, high-efficiency indirect lighting, and use of local building materials for some 85% of the project. The Orcutt/Winslow-built structure won the Education Design Showcase 2007 Project of Distinction Award. In addition, Verrado and Desert Edge High School (built by the same district in 2002 and 2005 with a similar LEED certification) have also received solar panel installations, which will be forthcoming to the other high schools in the district by September 2011. It is estimated that some 40 percent of the entire district's energy needs will come from these solar panels upon completion.
The Verrado Vipers and Lady Vipers compete in freshman, junior varsity, and varsity levels of sports in the 4A Conference, Division II, Skyline Region, which also includes Buckeye Union High School, Desert Edge High School, Liberty High School, Sierra Linda High School, Shadow Ridge High School, and Youngker High School. Verrado competes in all Arizona Interscholastic Association-sanctioned sports save for boys' volleyball and badminton.
This does not apply to certain sports (namely track and field, wrestling, swim and dive, and cross country) for the 2010-11 school year, as the Arizona Interscholastic Association in its realignment process has created separate division systems for all sports (most of which will begin in the next school year); it is also abolishing regions. Verrado will be part of the 4A Conference beginning with the 2011-13 realignment.
