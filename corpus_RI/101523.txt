The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year.''2005 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', Rutgers University Edward J.

The council appoints a professional borough administrator who is the Chief Administrative Officer of the Borough, responsible to the Mayor and Council.
Glen Rock Borough Government recognizes an annual "Poverty Awareness Week." The community comes together for an annual "Project" to combat extreme global poverty.
