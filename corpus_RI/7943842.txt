Solaren plans to provide this electrical power to PG&E's customers from solar panels mounted on satellites placed in Earth's orbit.The satellite would convert this energy into radio waves and send it to a receiving station in Fresno County, California. The plan is to provide 200 megawatts of continuous power, estimated as the average usage of 150,000 homes.
If successful, this project would be the first implementation of space-based solar power (SBSP). The concept was first dreamed up in 1941 by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in his short story "Reason", and was later described scientifically by Peter Glaser in 1968.
