The satellite was three-axis stabilized and in a near-circular orbit. It carried four instruments: a Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), and a Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS). About 50 MB were generated each day and this was stored on board by a 10.5 MB bubble memory recorder.
Because SXT utilized a charge-coupled device (CCD) as its readout device, perhaps being the first X-ray astronomical telescope to do so, its "data cube" of images was both extensive and convenient, and it revealed much interesting detail about the behavior of the solar corona. Previous solar soft X-ray observations, such as those of Skylab, had been restricted to film as a readout device. Many interesting new discoveries were also made; for glimpses of these see the , for example.
The mission ended after more than ten years of successful observation when it went into its "safehold" mode during an annular eclipse on December 14, 2001 after the spacecraft lost lock on the sun. Operational mistakes and other flaws conspired in such a way that its solar panels could no longer charge the batteries, which drained irreversibly; several other solar eclipses had successfully been observed.
On September 12, 2005 the spacecraft burned up during reentry over South Asia.  The time of reentry, as provided by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, was 6:16 pm Japan Standard Time (JST).
The CCD is 1024  1024 pixels with pixel angular size of 2.45     2.45   , point spread function core width (FWHM) is about 1.5 pixels (i.e. 3.7   ), field of view is 42     42   , which is a little larger than the whole solar disk. Typical time resolution is 2&nbsp;s in flare mode and 8&nbsp;s in quiet (no flare) mode, the maximum time resolution in 0.5&nbsp;s.
For spectral discrimination, STX employs wide-band filters installed on a filter wheel. There are five usable filter positions: '''1265&nbsp;A'''-thick '''Al''' filter (2.5&nbsp;A   36&nbsp;A pass band), '''Al/Mg/Mn''' filter (2.4&nbsp;A   32&nbsp;A), '''2.52&nbsp;  m Mg''' filter (2.4&nbsp;A   23&nbsp;A), '''11.6&nbsp;  m Al''' filter (2.4&nbsp;A   13&nbsp;A), '''119&nbsp;  m Be''' filter (2.3&nbsp;A   10&nbsp;A). Before the entrance filter failure in November 1992 three more filter positions were available: no analysis filter (2.5&nbsp;A   46&nbsp;A), Wide band optical filter (4600&nbsp;A   4800&nbsp;A), Narrow band optical filter (4290&nbsp;A   4320&nbsp;A).
