This rural community can be characterized by its Czechoslovakian heritage. The original settlement was by Czech and German immigrants who brought their traditions and customs to the rural landscape of the Montgomery area around 1856-1860.
The Torch Light Parade and fireworks are held every year near the end of November.
Montgomery is also home to Big Honza's Museum of Unnatrual History.
Annually, Montgomery celebrates their Czechoslovakian heritage at the end of July with one of Minnesota's oldest festivals, ''Kolacky Days''.
The festival dates back to 1929, when an estimated 6,000 people visited Montgomery for the first Kolacky Day celebration, held on October 1.
Events at the first celebration included a trap shooting tournament, a parade, sports and races and a football game between Montgomery and Le Sueur Center (now Le Center).
In 1931 Miss Leatta Ehmke, (Mrs. Joe Trnka) was crowned the first Kolacky Queen by Mayor Henry Westerman. Her attendants were Ella Krocak, Sylvia Zelenka, Anna Zelenka and Berniece Malone.
For the 1934 celebration, a novelty button, sold by the Kolacky girls, was devised and is still in use today.
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kolacky Day retreated to the background until the Montgomery Community Club revived the celebration in 1948.
Kolacky Days officially became a summer festival in 1966 when the traditional date, the last Sunday in September, was dropped in favor of the first weekend in August. The earlier date and warmer weather brought huge crowds to the festival. Currently, the festival is celebrated the fourth full weekend in July.
In 1975, Kolacky Day became Kolacky Days and the event was held for the first time at the end of July. The move to July was done at the urging of the Green Giant vegetable canning company in order to avoid conflict with the busy corn processing season.
Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak competed in the kolacky eating contest against Montgomery Mayor Mick McGuire in 2008 and again in 2010.
2010 Marked the 76th annual Kolacky Days.  The 77th annual Kolacky Days will begin July 22, 2011.
