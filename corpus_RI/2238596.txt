Gyllenhammar graduated from Lund University with a degree in law in 1959. He replaced his father, Pehr Gyllenhammar Sr., as CEO of insurance company Skandia in 1970. After only a few months he moved to Volvo where he became the CEO. He replaced his father-in-law Gunnar Engellau, who became chairman, in that position.
Member of the International Advisory Committee of Chase Manhattan Bank 1972-1995.
Gyllenhammar became one of the most famous businessmen in Sweden at Volvo. He mixed success with failure. He oversaw a wide-reaching diversification of Volvo's business, buying, among other things pharmaceutical company Pharmacia. What finally forced him to leave Volvo was a failed merger with French company Renault.
After Volvo, Gyllenhammar withdrew from Swedish public life and moved to London where he eventually became chairman of insurance company Aviva. He returned to Swedish business in 2004 as Chairman of Investment AB Kinnevik.
Gyllenhammar is no longer a member of Investment AB Kinnevik's board. 
He serves as a director of the Reuters Founders Share Company since 1997 (now Chairman) and was awarded in 2003 an honorary doctorate by Gothenburg School of Economics and Commercial Law.
Majid Al Futtaim Group, a major business chain in the United Arab Emirates, lists Mr Gyllenhammar as its Chairman. 
Gyllenhammar has in the past been an outspoken supporter of the Liberal People's Party. In his 1973 book ''I Believe in Sweden'' (''Jag tror pa Sverige'') he was steadfast in his support for the Scandinavian model and argued for the kind social liberalism the Liberal People's Party used to support. Gyllenhammar served on the Party board and was widely considered as a future leader of the party. At times, he revealed an ambition to become Prime Minister of Sweden.
Gyllenhammar is married to Christina Gyllenhammar (born Engellau in 1936). They live in London and have three daughters and one son: Cecilia, Charlotte, Sophie, and Oscar.
