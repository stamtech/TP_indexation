The wireless broadband dongles work on the 3G mobile phone/data network, so I was wondering. If they do support voice do you know if they support voice on common linux distributions? --  ( ) 08:37, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
I have a short bookmark .json file that I would like to merge with my existing Firefox bookmarks. I arrange my bookmarks in folders, and the names of some of the folders could be the same. What would be the best way to merge them please?   ( ) 11:40, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
After leaving my WinXP computer on but unattended for say a hour or so, when I came back Firefox will not load any webpages. After a long pause it says something like "website unavailable". Even when I click the Try Again button, same result, although instantly and without any delay this time. This is even with dependable websites like Google or the BBC news. However Internet Explorer has no problems displaying there same websites in the same circumstances. After IE has made a connection, then Firefox makes a connection easily as normal. Firefox has no problems loading webpages when doing so soon after the computer has been switched on and started.  
What could be the problem and how could I fix it please?   ( ) 11:55, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
I do exit Firefox when leaving the computer, at least I close the Firefox window which I assume is exiting Firefox. I have this problem with Firefox 3.6.3 and earlier versions. My connection is broadband.   ( ) 17:04, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
Extensions: 1-Click YouTube Video Downloader, Adblock Plus, CacheViewer, deskcut, Flagfox, Image Zoom, TinEye. Themes: default theme.

I see I have two Java things - do not know if that is an error or not. I am not on a corporate network. I use the default Windows XP firewall. More specifically, Firefox says something like 'cannot find server' when I have this problem. Thanks   ( ) 19:37, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
Logical, but since I'd have to wait an hour between disabling, even doing half of them at a time, then I'm probably just going to live with it.   ( ) 20:05, 12 April 2010 (UTC)
Lets say in the near future quantum computers were common, laptops were quantum computers, even cellphones had quantum pocessors. How would the qubits be transfered in between them? Could a version of modern connecton cables be used like USB, or would it require a completely new way of connectng devices, a complete redisign of the cables used?

How come to log in to gmail you just have to type your "Username" (without the "@gmail.com"), but to log in to yahoo mail you have to type in your "Yahoo ID" plus "@yahoo.com"? 
It is, of course, easier to log in to and check your email at gmail simply because you don't have to type in "@gmail.com".
Did yahoo not think of this? Or is there some other reason?   ( ) 15:57, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
I don't ever have to type in the "@yahoo" when I log into Yahoo mail. Perhaps I have bookmarked a secondary sign in screen?   ( ) 18:20, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
In Active Directory I can require some complexity for passwords.  If I feel that this is to lax what do I do?
Ie. how do I prevent "H3lloWorld" from beeing a legal password? Some protection can be given by enforcing password length, but this I feel is somewhat annoyoing and it does not prevent "H3lloWorld1234567890", or similiar use of padding to get the required length.   ( ) 17:11, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
Hi, just wondering what would be the most major effect of misusing the Mac OS X Terminal program. Would my computer fail to start up completely? Would certain programs not work? How powerful is the program potentially?  . 20:41, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
I just jailbroke my iPhone 3G. I also just found out about iPhone OS 4.0, which makes me wonder, "Am i eligible for an upgrade once the next iPhone comes out, since I jailbroke it? I know my warranty's voided, but am i still eligible?" Thanks!     Preceding   comment added by   ( ) 21:21, 8 April 2010 (UTC)
