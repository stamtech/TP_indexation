I can't find any significant coverage in   sources for this software. The two secondary sources in the article are blogs. It's true that one of them is Yahoo! Search Blog, but it's about the acquisition of this software by Yahoo. It might be merged with Yahoo, but seem rather trivial to mention there (one of the many start-up they bought), and it's not mentioned in any book on Safari (web browser) I could search on google books, so it's probably   and   to mention it there.     12:00, 24 December 2009 (UTC)
