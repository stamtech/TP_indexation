The '''L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park''' is home to the University of Oklahoma Sooners baseball team.
Mitchell Park was named after Dale Mitchell, a mid-1940s Sooner letterman who holds OU's career and single-season batting records. The park was originally constructed at a cost of $1.27 million and was dedicated in 1982. 
Renovations during the 1998 season included an upper concourse plus additional rest rooms and concession stands. The locker room, training room and equipment room were also updated. Prior to the 2002 season, the press box and broadcast booths were significantly expanded and an elevator and VIP suites were added. . SoonerSports.com
