In January 1942 another 60 Strv m/42s were ordered. Some of this batch were built under license by Volvo, and 55 of them fitted with the Scania engine. The remaining five were equipped with a new Volvo engine. In June 1942 another 80 were ordered from Landsverk. In April 1943 another 282 were ordered from Volvo.
They were phased out of active service in the 1950s and replaced by the Stridsvagn 81. 235 of them were rebuilt to the Stridsvagn 74 and the type Eh vehicles were transferred to Infantry-gun Vehicles as IKv 73s. The turrets where reused as static gun pillboxes, mostly defending harbours and more seldom airfields.
