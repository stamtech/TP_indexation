The '''Motorola MOTO Z6c''' is a mobile phone which features both CDMA and GSM network capability in one device. It is offered in The United States by the Verizon Wireless network.  It shares the same slider form factor as the Motorola RIZR Z3.
Along with the BlackBerry 8830 World Edition Smart Phone, this is only one of two devices offered by Verizon Wireless that will work outside of North America.  Unlike the BlackBerry, the device features no GSM data protocols, rendering it usable only as a cell phone with SMS capability whilst on the GSM network.
When opened, the top portion slides upwards, revealing the standard keys (including numeric, star, and pound keys). These keys are covered when the phone is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys are automatically locked shortly after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.
One of the primary uses of the device when closed is as a landscape still or video camera. When operating in landscape mode, the user holds the phone on its side (90 degrees counter-clockwise), such that the camera key is positioned near the right index finger. The screen text and icons are also rotated, so that they appear normally when held in this fashion. This gives the impression of the phone being more like a traditional camera.
Motorola also manufacture a similar version, the Z6cx, which omits the camera.
