Best remembered for their 1993 single "No Rain", the group enjoyed critical and commercial success in the early 1990s with their neo-psychedelic take on alternative rock. The 1995 death of lead vocalist Shannon Hoon halted the band's activity, and the members went on hiatus until officially disbanding in 1999. The band reformed with new lead vocalist Travis Warren in 2006, and although Warren departed two years later, he has since resumed performing with the band.
It's possible that Blind Melon is some form of reference to the 1920s' Blues artist Blind Lemon Jefferson. Cheech & Chong had an act involving a character named Blind Melon Chitlin  which was itself a reference to Blind Lemon. Another story states that the band took its name from the bassist Brad's father, who teased the band calling them "Blind Melons". Even if this story is the true inspiration, the possibility that the father took the reference from either the early blues artist or the skit in parody of him still exists. The reference to Blind Lemon Jefferson also fits the band's blues-influenced style.
Blind Melon formed in California in 1989, with members from Indiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania. The band signed to Capitol Records in 1991 and recorded an unreleased demo. The band's initial popularity is partially attributed to vocalist Hoon's association with Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose, and Hoon's backing vocals on several Guns N' Roses tracks on 1991's ''Use Your Illusion'' album (one example being "Don't Cry").  
The band's self-titled debut album, produced by Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam), contained 13 songs and sold poorly until the "No Rain" single was released in September 1993. The single, promoted by a music video featuring the "Bee Girl" (played by Heather DeLoach), helped launch the commercial success of the band, eventually leading the album to quadruple-platinum status, debuting in the Billboard top 40 on 10/9/93 and peaking at #11 on the Hot 100.
In 1994, the band began recording its second album, ''Soup'', in New Orleans with producer Andy Wallace.  The album was released in 1995, and predominantly featured shorter songs with a less conventional alternative rock approach. The lyrics to "St. Andrew's Fall" referenced a suicide jump, while "New Life" discussed the forthcoming birth of Hoon's child. "Mouthful of Cavities" featured backing vocals from Jena Kraus, who subsequently recorded a solo record with Christopher Thorn and Brad Smith. Possibly because of the more experimental sound (the album begins and ends with New Orleans style jazz and has a hodgepodge of instrumentation throughout), the album failed to meet sales expectations.
In 1995, Blind Melon contributed a version of the song "Out on the Tiles" to the ''Encomium'' tribute album to Led Zeppelin, as well as a promotional CD with a cover of the Schoolhouse Rock! song "Three Is a Magic Number." "Three Is a Magic Number" features in the film ''Never Been Kissed'', as well as in the film ''Slackers'' several years later.
Against the advice of Hoon's drug counselor, Blind Melon went on tour in support of ''Soup''. Hoon was found dead on the band's tour bus of a heart attack, caused by a cocaine overdose, on October 21, 1995 in New Orleans. 
The remaining members released ''Nico'' (named for Hoon's daughter, only 13 weeks old when her father died) in 1996, with the profits going to a program that helps musicians with drug and alcohol addiction. ''Nico'' contained unreleased songs from the ''Soup'' recording sessions, as well as other songs often recorded with only partial instrumentation. The closing track, "Letters from a Porcupine", was recorded as a telephone message left by Hoon on Thorn's answering machine. ''Nico'' included covers of Steppenwolf and John Lennon songs.
During this period, without Hoon, the relationships between the band's main members disintegrated as they attempted to recruit a new front man. Rumors began to spread of a breakup and while efforts were made to reconcile, a split seemed likely.
Blind Melon officially disbanded on March 4, 1999 and the various members went on to other projects.
In 2002, Capitol Records released a ''Classic Masters'' CD showcasing twelve Blind Melon songs. Thanks to stronger-than-expected sales, the band released ''The Best of Blind Melon'' in 2005, a CD   DVD package that features Blind Melon performing live from a September 1995 concert in Chicago. On December 15, 2006, a tribute album to Blind Melon was released by Yakmusic in New Zealand featuring bands from all over the world. In April 2006, Capitol Records released the ''Live at the Palace'' CD that was re-released October 17, 2006 with a new package.
On September 15, 2006, it was announced that Blind Melon had reunited, with the addition of new lead singer Travis Warren (formerly of Rain Fur Rent). On November 9, 2006 three new Blind Melon songs were released: "Make a Difference", "For My Friends" and "Harmful Belly". On October 7, 2007 Blind Melon performed their first show in twelve years in Providence, Rhode Island. 
On April 22, 2008, the band released ''For My Friends'' on Adrenaline Records. The first single, "Wishing Well", was released on March 4, 2008. A U.S. tour in support of the album began February 28. Around this time, ''Billboard'' confirmed that a book about the Hoon era of the band is forthcoming. Then, on September 17, 2008, the book ''A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon'' by Greg Prato was published. 
In September 2008, Blind Melon played a number of European tour dates, with Warren as lead vocalist.  On November 6, 2008, the band announced the departure of Warren.  The reasons behind his departure are disputed: Warren states that he was ejected from the band after having lost his voice due to extensive touring, while the band cites unresponsiveness and lack of communication and that Warren chose to leave the band on his own.  Initially, the band intended to honour their remaining dates, and announced Chris Shinn of Unified Theory as lead vocalist for the remainder of their tour. However, this was later retracted, and the tour cancelled, with the band stating that Shinn simply didn't have enough time to prepare. 
After clearing the air with the rest of the band, Warren returned to perform a previously scheduled gig with Blind Melon on December 31, 2008 in Dearborn, Michigan, which the band later announced would be the last show with him.
Blind Melon have stated their intention to continue looking for a permanent vocalist and carry on regardless.
Capitol Records released a 4 track EP entitled "Deep Cuts" in April 2009 as a digital download. The band had no input into this ep, but it is an official release.
It was reported on May 23 that Smith and Thorn were invited to play with Codename Mike. and that Graham has formed a new band named Jakeleg. with his long time friend Joe Tullos. There has been no further announcement on the state of Blind Melon, so it is currently assumed that these developments are in addition to searching for a replacement for Warren.
On January 23, 2010, Graham posted a message on the band's MySpace profile stating that the group were still in the process of sourcing a frontman capable of filling 'some rather large shoes'.
On November 2, 2010, Blind Melon announced 3 dates with Travis Warren singing.  On November 27, Blind Melon played a free concert at the base of Aspen mountain in Aspen, Colorado.  They continued sporadic performances over the coming months, opening for Candlebox at The Hard Rock Hotel in Albuquerque, New Mexico on February 4, 2011.
