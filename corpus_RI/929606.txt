The '''Sands Expo and Convention Center''', at 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m  ), is the second largest convention center in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. It opened in 1990 across the street from the original Sands Hotel.
Located at 201 Sands Avenue Las Vegas, Nevada, the Sands Expo is owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. It is frequently used for conventions booked at The Venetian hotel and casino (which is owned by the same company) and as overflow space for conventions that outgrow the Las Vegas Convention Center.
In 2008, an expansion for the Sands Expo Center was announced. The first part would add another story to the existing building and build a new two-million square foot Expo center, built on the Sands owned land east of the Wynn Las Vegas employee parking garage. A long pedestrian bridge will be built between the two Expos. 
Also, half of the existing building will be covered by a new condo tower and hotel, adding to the already large complex, which also includes The Venetian and The Palazzo.
