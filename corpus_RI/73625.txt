As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 64,234. Its most famous resident was Richard Nixon, who was born there; however, his father moved the family away before Yorba Linda became a city. The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum is therefore probably the most well-known and visited site in the city.
Yorba Linda is known for having large residential lots as well as 30 horse trails, which are  in aggregate length.
In 2005 CNN ranked Yorba Linda 21st among the best places in the U.S. to live. Similarly, in an article by CNN Money, Yorba Linda was one of the richest U.S. cities and the highest in Orange County as reported by the Census data, showing median household income of over $120K: "Among towns of between 65,000 and 250,000 in population, Yorba Linda, California, where six-figure incomes are the rule, had the highest median income at $121,075"
===Pre-colonization==This area was the home of the Luiseno, Tongva, and Juaneno Indians at one time. Back in 1920-30's a man by the name Antonio De Brea used to preform extrocisms in various areas around the adresses of 1726 tympani circle, and 1743 tympani circle.
In 1834 Bernardo Yorba, son of Jose Antonio Yorba, was granted the  Rancho Canon de Santa Ana by Mexican governor Jose Figueroa. Most of this original land was retained after the Mexican American war in 1848, by descendants of the original Yorba family.  A portion of the city's land is still owned and developed by descendants of Samuel Letscher, who acquired it through his marriage to Angelina Yorba, the great granddaughter of Bernardo Yorba. The Yorba family still owns portions of Yorba Linda, and there is still the Yorba Ranch on the side of the 91 freeway.  The site of the Bernardo Yorba Hacienda, referred to as the Don Bernardo Yorba Ranch House Site, is listed as a California Historical Landmark.
 The land was given to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles by Bernardo in the year of his death, 1858, since Orange County was not established out of Los Angeles County as a separate county until 1889. The cemetery closed in 1939 and was subsequently vandalized; however, in the 1960s, the Orange County Board of Supervisors took possession of the property in order to begin to undo the damage, and tours are now available one day per month.
A section of the land was sold in 1907 to the Janss Investment Company, which first called the area Yorba Linda, and proceeded to subdivide the land and sell it for agriculture and manufacturing. In 1910, the agricultural aspect of that endeavor materialized, and the first of many lemon and orange groves were planted: at the time, the population was still less than 50. A year later, The Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company began serving Yorba Linda, and the first school was constructed.
In 1912 several things happened in Yorba Linda: it received its first post office; the Yorba Linda Citrus Association was founded; the Southern California Edison Company began providing electricity; and the first church was constructed. The area that would later become downtown was also connected to Los Angeles by the Pacific Electric Railway in 1912, primarily for citrus transport.
In 1913, Richard Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, the chamber of commerce was set up, a library opened as part of the school, and avocado trees were first planted. A year later a separate district was established for the library system.
In 1915, the Susanna Bixby Bryant Ranch house was constructed. It is now a museum and can be toured by the public.
In 1917, the Yorba Linda Star began publication. It has since become an online section of the OC Register. However, a printed version of just the Star still exists and is available at various city buildings free of charge and is delivered to every household in Yorba Linda each Thursday. Moreover, its past articles are available for viewing on microfilm at the Yorba Linda Public Library. In that same year, the first street was paved, Yorba Linda Boulevard.
The population exceeded 300 for the first time prior to 1920. In 1929, the citrus association's packing house burned down, as it was made of wood. It reopened the next year.
The small town had grown significantly by the 1960s, with over 1,000 residents by the 1960 Census, and survived or fought off three annexation considerations or attempts: one by Brea in 1958 and one each by Anaheim and Placentia in 1963. These experiences culminated in incorporation, which occurred in 1967.
The new city drew up and implemented its municipal general plan in 1972. By the 1980 Census, the population was nearing 30,000. Within ten years it exceeded 50,000.
In 1990, the Birthplace of Richard Nixon opened as a public library and museum. It would later become a federal presidential library. In 1994, the community center opened.
In 2007, Yorba Linda High School finally broke ground after many years of planning.
In November 2008, eastern Yorba Linda  suffered from fires that destroyed 113 homes and damaged 50 others. The destruction was due largely to erratic winds causing embers to fly up to half a mile away. William Lockhart, captain of the Orange County Fire Authority, reported that water pressure is good when fighting a single family home fire, but during a profound firestorm, as was the case in this event, perfect pressure from every single hydrant at the same time is not possible.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.0 square miles (51.8&nbsp;km  ).  19.5 square miles (50.5&nbsp;km  ) of it is land and 0.5 square miles (1.4&nbsp;km  ) of it (2.67%) is water.
It has two ZIP codes, 92886 and 92887, which approximately serve the western and eastern portions of the city, respectively. A third, 92885, also exists, exclusively for PO Boxes. The city is served by area codes 657 and 714 in a geographical overlay situation, in which 714 numbers were running out, so that 657 numbers are now also being issued in the same area. Ten-digit dialing is therefore now required for local calls.
It is bordered by Anaheim on the south, Placentia on the west and southwest, Brea on the northwest, Chino Hills State Park on the north, and Corona in Riverside County on the east.
The two nearest seismic faults are the Whittier Fault and the Chino Fault, both of which are part of the Elsinore Fault Zone.
The city receives 14 to 15 inches of rain per year on average. The average temperatures in January and July are 55 and 71 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, with the overall average for the year at 63. Humidity, likewise respectively, is 52%, 60%, and 56% on average.
The two main commercially zoned areas of the city are Savi Ranch, which straddles Weir Canyon Road / Yorba Linda Boulevard and is discussed in more detail below, and a section along the north side of La Palma Avenue, which is primarily an office park.
There are other, smaller shopping centers as well, however, which are primarily retail, including, among others:
There are over 1,000 commercial businesses in the city in all, with more than 1,500 additional ones based out of residents' homes. The city also owns Black Gold Golf Club.
Savi Ranch today contains retailers, auto dealers, restaurants, hotels, and office buildings. The major stores are Best Buy, Petsmart, Staples, La-Z-Boy, Denny's Diner, Chick-fil-A, McDonald's, Taco Bell, Bed Bath & Beyond, Kohl's, and Costco Wholesale. The eastern side of Savi Ranch is the Yorba Linda side and is larger than the western side, which lies within Anaheim.
Originally, the city pursued construction of an auto mall on the entire Savi Ranch site. Although multiple car lots do presently exist, the original plan was rejected by residents, in favor of a combination of retail stores, restaurants, hotels, and office buildings. Moreover, as of 2010, two of the three car dealer locations sit empty, one of which only sold used cars. For a time, all three sat in disrepair, and the only dealer in operation now is a custom one that caters to high-end buyers.
As a significant source of sales tax revenue to Yorba Linda and as one of the first anchor tenants (along with Best Buy), The Home Depot became a political talking point in its own right.
This is due to the fact that Savi Ranch is divided into two sections, East and West. Savi Ranch East is the Yorba Linda side, while Savi Ranch West lies within Anaheim. At the inception of Savi Ranch, The Home Depot was located in Savi Ranch East. In the early 2000s, however, the Super Kmart location in Savi Ranch West went out of business, and The Home Depot moved into that location to build what was at the time the company's largest store and in the process took the sales tax across the city boundary.
According to the City's 2008 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Yorba Linda was one of just three California cities to pass a measure in their city council proclaiming its support for the controversial Arizona immigration law, SB1070.
In early 2011, outside a fundraising event for the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations held at the Yorba Linda Community Center, there was a protest by local conservative and anti-Islamic groups. The sponsor of the fundraiser claimed it was for Islamic charities. The protestors claimed the event was raising money for terrorists.
The city council consists of five members that are elected by residents to four-year terms, with a three-term limits. A city manager is hired by the council to run day-to-day operations of the city. The council elects its own mayor at the end of every year from within its ranks, whose duty is to "preside over the meetings and represent the city at various functions." The combination of these two things means that the city employs a council-manager form of government.
The council members are:
Management of the city and coordination of city services is provided by:
Yorba Linda has four commissions, which meet monthly or bimonthly, to advise the city council about their respective projects.
The library commission operates the Yorba Linda Public Library, which has existed in some form since 1913, and is composed of five residents whose duties include selecting new materials for the library to acquire and establishing guidelines and regulations, among other things.
The planning commission is in charge of matters pertaining to land use, zoning, annexation, right-of-ways, and construction of new buildings, among other things; however, its five members are appointed by the council.
The traffic commission seeks to address issues of safety, flow, public complaints, parking, and others. Members serve terms of two years.
The parks and recreation commission is composed of council-appointed members as well and is tasked with a variety of responsibilities for all of the city's facilities and trails.
The schedules for all of the commissions' meeting times and places can be viewed here.
Law enforcement is currently contracted out to the Brea Police Department, which has a satellite administrative office in Yorba Linda.
This arrangement began in the 1970s, marking the first time in the state's history that a municipality, as opposed to a county sheriff's department, provided police services to another municipality. Prior to this setup, but after the city's incorporation in 1967, Yorba Linda did contract with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which was and still is typical for municipalities that are not large enough or simply choose not to maintain an in-house police department. These few years, from 1967 to the switch to Brea's force, would have therefore been natural, as any sheriff's department is tasked with serving the unincorporated areas in its county.
In the past, Yorba Linda has been rated one of the safest cities in the United States.
Fire services are provided by the Orange County Fire Authority.
The Yorba Linda Water District, headquartered in Placentia, serves nearly all residents. Golden State Water, which also has a field office in Placentia, serves the remainder.
The city contracts out waste collection to Yorba Linda Disposal. 
Natural gas is provided by Southern California Gas Company, and electricity is provided by Southern California Edison.
Yorba Linda is part of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. This district is home to nearly 28,000 students.
Several schools in the district have received the California Distinguished School award.
The districts schools are categorized below.
Elementary:
Middle:
High school:
St. Francis of Assisi School serves as the only Catholic school in the city.  Many parents seeking a private school education for their children send their PS-8th graders to Heritage Oak Private School and high schoolers to nearby Lutheran High School of Orange County in the city of Orange, Servite High School (boys) or Rosary High School (girls) in Anaheim, or Mater Dei High School (co-ed) in Santa Ana.
The brand-new Yorba Linda High School, home of the Mustangs, started instruction in Fall 2009, in addition to one private high school also planned for construction in 2009. Historically, many Yorba Linda students also attended Troy High School in nearby Fullerton, Valencia High School in neighboring Placentia, or El Dorado High School, also located in Placentia.
There are two Montessori Preschools in Yorba Linda:
In the state legislature Yorba Linda is located in the 29th Senate District, which is represented by Republican Bob Huff. From the eastern part of the city towards the west, roughly, Yorba Linda is in the 60th and 72nd Assembly Districts, which are respectively represented by Republicans Curt Hagman and Chris Norby.
In the United States House of Representatives, the city is located in the 42nd District, which has a Cook PVI of R +10 and is represented by Republican Gary Miller.
Current or former Yorba Lindans of note include:
