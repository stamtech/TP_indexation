 Smith is the largest privately endowed college for women in the country.  The campus was planned and planted in the 1890s as a botanical garden and arboretum, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. The campus landscape now encompasses  and includes more than 1,200 varieties of trees and shrubs.
Smith has been led by 10 presidents and two acting presidents.  For the 1975 centennial, the college inaugurated its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway (Elizabeth Cutter Morrow was the first actual president of Smith College and the first female head of a college in the USA, she did not use the title of president), who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto.  Since President Conway's term, all Smith presidents have been women, with the exception of John M. Connolly's one-year term as acting president in the interim after President Simmons left to lead Brown University.
Smith recently joined the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission.
Smith runs its own junior year abroad (JYA) programs in four European cities: Paris, Hamburg, Florence and Geneva.  These programs are notable for requiring all studies to be conducted in the language of the host country (with both Paris and Geneva programs conducted in French).  In some cases students live in homestays with local families.  Nearly half of Smith's juniors study overseas, either through Smith JYA programs or at more than 40 other locations around the world.
Junior math majors from other undergraduate institutions are invited to study at Smith College for one year through the Center for Women in Mathematics.  Established in the fall of 2007 by Professors Ruth Haas and Jim Henle, the program aims to allow young women to improve their mathematical abilities through classwork, research and involvement in a department centered on women.   The Center also offers a post-baccalaureate year of math study to women who either did not major in mathematics as undergraduates or whose mathematics major was not strong.
The Louise W. and Edmund J. Kahn Liberal Arts Institute supports collaborative research without regard to the traditional boundaries of academic departments and programs. Each year the Institute supports long-term and short-term projects proposed, planned and organized by members of the Smith College faculty. By becoming Kahn Fellows, students get involved in interdisciplinary research projects and work alongside faculty and visiting scholars for a year.
Students can develop leadership skills through Smith's two-year Phoebe Reese Lewis Leadership Program. Participants train in public speaking, analytical thinking, teamwork strategies and the philosophical aspects of leadership.
Through Smith's internship program, "Praxis: The Liberal Arts at Work," every undergraduate is guaranteed access to one college funded internship during her years at the college. This program enables students to access interesting self-generated internship positions in social welfare and human services, the arts, media, health, education, and other fields.
The Ada Comstock Scholars Program is a bachelor's degree program for non-traditional students.
Also offered in a non-degree studies program is the Diploma in American Studies. This is a highly competitive one-year program open only to international students of advanced undergraduate or graduate standing. It is designed primarily, although not exclusively, for those who are teaching or who plan to teach some aspect of American culture and institutions.
The Smith College master of social work (M.S.W.) degree is nationally recognized for its specialization in clinical social work and puts a heavy emphasis on direct field work practice. The program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The school also offers a Ph.D. program designed to prepare MSWs for leadership positions in clinical research education and practice.
The college has a limited number of other programs leading to Ph.D.s, and is part of a cooperative doctoral program co-administered by Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Smith College has many different houses serving as dormitories. Each house is self-governing and collects its own dues. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows.
Houses are found in three main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street/Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question.
A new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008.  The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams   and to generate school spirit broadly. It will be used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women   s college to join the NCAA, the new mark is seen as linking the college   s pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today. 
Smith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is currently blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.
Smith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then "follows" them through to graduation.  Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.
Two recent additions to the campus, both of which enhance its sense of community, are the architecturally dramatic Campus Center  and the state-of-the-art Olin Fitness Center.
In 2009, construction was also completed on Ford Hall, a new science and engineering facility.  According to the Smith College website, Ford Hall is a "...facility that will intentionally blur the boundaries between traditional disciplines, creating an optimum environment for students and faculty to address key scientific and technological developments of our time."  The building was officially dedicated on October 16, 2009.
The campus also boasts a botanic garden that includes a Japanese tea house, a variety of specialty gardens including a rock garden, and historic glass greenhouses dating back to 1895. It is rumored that the architecture of Chapin House was the inspiration for the one in Tara in ''Gone with the Wind''. (Margaret Mitchell went to Smith for one year.)
A novelty of Smith's homelike atmosphere is the continuing popularity of Sophia Smith's recipe  for molasses cookies. These are often served at the traditional Friday afternoon tea held in each house, where students, faculty and staff members and alumnae socialize.
Smith offers "panel discussions and seminars for lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students on subjects such as coming out as transgender at work."   In 2003, Smith students voted to remove pronouns from the language of the Student Government Association constitution, in order to make that document inclusive of transgendered students who don't identify with the female pronouns "she" and "her."
The Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years, plus a special two-year reunion. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; "off-year" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the "Class of 1776."
Traditional reunion and Commencement events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.
Until the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. "Significant" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.
Smith has numerous folk tales and ghost stories that emerge from the histories of some of its historic buildings. One such tale holds that Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne.  Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, General Burgoyne. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed that the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 1900s, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.
Smith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complimenting this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts. In Spring 2009, the campus actively participated in Earth Hour, an effort to shut off lights around the world.
In keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of "to-go" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. To further decrease use of disposable cups, Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Nalgenes, in particular, have achieved an almost trend-like status at Smith since the popularization of sustainability and reusability.
Those dining halls that still offer "To-Go" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, biodegradable plastic, and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose.
For Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of "A-" on the "College Sustainability Report Card 2010" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.
A number of Smith alumnae have gone on to become notable in their respective fields and endeavors.  Some examples include:
Dorothy Canning Miller, Museum curator
The Alumnae Association of Smith College considers all former students to be members, whether they graduated or not, and does not generally differentiate between graduates and non-graduates when identifying Smith alumnae.
References to Smith abound in literature. In Sylvia Plath's novel ''The Bell Jar'', the protagonist Esther Greenwood attends Smith College. In ''Running With Scissors,'' a memoir by Augusten Burroughs, the author details how he and his foster-sister, Natalie, took walks together on the campus. The fictional Catamount College in the novella ''Beasts'' by Joyce Carol Oates is based on Smith College. The character Chenault in ''The Rum Diary'' by Hunter S. Thompson went to Smith College. ''Commencement'', a novel by J. Courtney Sullivan was published in 2009 and recounts the friendship of four Smith College classmates.
Smith has its place in films as well. The 1954 film ''White Christmas'' referenced Smith. Jean Simmons plays a recent Smith grad in 1957's "This Could Be the Night". The 1966 movie ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and the 1993 movie ''Malice'' were both filmed on the Smith campus. In the 1971 film ''Carnal Knowledge'', Candice Bergen's character, Susan, is a Smith student, and portions of the film take place on the Smith campus. The character Joanna Kramer, played by Meryl Streep in the 1979 film ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' is a Smith College graduate. In the movie ''The Nanny Diaries'' Mrs. X is a Smith alumna. Spike Lee also has a reference to a Smithie as a lesbian paying an ex-biotech exec to inseminate her and many other homosexual women in the movie ''She Hate Me''. Sadie (Nicole Vicius) from 2007 lesbian-comedy Itty Bitty Titty Committee dropped out of the college after meeting her partner, a guest lecturer at Smith.
Well-known television shows integrate references to Smith into character plot lines. Charlotte York in the show ''Sex and the City'' is a Smith College graduate. In an episode of ''The Simpsons''   "I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can"   Lisa Simpson is tempted by the Siren-like representatives of the Seven Sisters (and George Plimpton), who offer a scholarship to the Sister school of her choice (and a George Plimpton hot plate) if she will throw a
Spelling Bee. Dr. Cristina Yang, a surgical resident played by Sandra Oh on ''Grey's Anatomy'', graduated from Smith College with degrees in French Literature and Chemistry, and lived in Talbot House. Ainsley Hayes (played by Emily Procter), the conservative lawyer hired to work in the White House Counsel's Office on ''The West Wing'', graduated from Smith. In an episode of ''Mad About You'' Paul's sister and her girlfriend are referred to as "The Fighting Lesbians." Paul (Paul Reiser) replies, "No, that would be the name of the Smith College Ice Hockey Team." Emily Gilmore in the show ''Gilmore Girls'' went to Smith and majored in history. In season two of "Nip Tuck"- episode "Julia McNamara", Julia gets anesthesia before her facial surgery. One of the dreams she has is that Dr. Liz Cruz's made-up daughter will be attending Smith that coming fall.  In the third season of ER, Dr. Doug Ross (played by George Clooney) mentions he is dating a Smith graduate.  Nurse Carol Hathaway makes a joke about Dr. Ross's normal dates being unable to spell Smith.  A very similar joke was made in the movie White Christmas, which starred George Clooney's aunt, Rosemary Clooney.
In the 2009 ''Heroes'' episode "A Clear and Present Danger", the Smith College viewbook is displayed prominently at the top of a stack of college materials Claire Bennet is apparently reviewing. Angela Petrelli asks Claire if she's found a favorite, to which Claire replies, "Hamilton, Smith, Georgetown, they're all the best schools in the country."
The webcomic Questionable Content mentions Smith College (usually referred to as "Smif" in the comic) as the place where one of the main characters, Marten, is employed as library staff, and several of the minor characters attend. Ellen, studies marine biology. Tai, Natasha and Cosette are also students. Jeph Jacques, the author, went to Hampshire College, one of the neighboring schools.
Some characters from the webcomic Minimalist Stick Figure Theatre, set primarily in Northampton, are students at Smith College.
In a recent Hallmark Channel original movie titled "Mrs. Washington Goes to Smith," Cybill Shepherd stars in a story about a woman in her 40s who returns to Smith College to finish her bachelor's degree. Smith alumna Susan Rice '63 wrote the script for the film, which aired August 1, 2009.
In the 1960 novel "The Tight White Collar" by Grace Metalious, the character Margery Cooper attends Smith College.
