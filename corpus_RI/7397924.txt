Feather Christmas trees, originally of German origin, became popular in the United States as well. Feather trees were initially made of green-dyed goose feathers which were attached to wire branches. These wire branches were then wrapped around a central dowel which acted as the trunk Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 2&nbsp;inch tree to a large 98&nbsp;inch tree sold in department stores during the 1920s. Often, the tree branches were tipped with artificial red berries which acted as candle holders. The branches were widely spaced to keep the candles from starting a fire, which allowed ample space for ornamentation. Other benefits touted for feather trees included the elimination of a trip to the tree lot and the lack of shed needles.Marling, Karal Ann. ''Merry Christmas!: Celebrating America's Greatest Holiday'', (), Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 58&ndash;62, (ISBN 0674003187).
In 1930 the U.S.-based Addis Brush Company created the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.Cole, Peter, et al. ''Christmas Trees: Fun and Festive Ideas'', (), Chronicle Books, 2002, p. 23, (ISBN 0811835774). The company used the same machinery that it used to manufacture toilet brushes. The trees were made from the same animal-hair bristles used in the brushes, save they were dyed green. For a time, the brush trees were immensely popular, with large numbers exported to Great Britain, where the trees also became popular. These brush trees offered advantages over the earlier feather trees. They could accept heavier ornamentation, and were not nearly as flammable.
Aluminium Christmas trees are a type of artificial tree that are made largely from aluminium. The trees were manufactured in the United States, first in Chicago in 1958, and later in Manitowoc, Wisconsin where the majority of the trees were produced.Andrews, Candice Gaukel. ''Great Wisconsin Winter Weekends'', (), Big Earth Publishing, 2006, p. 178, (ISBN 1931599718) Aluminum trees were manufactured into the 1970s,Fortin, Cassandra A.

The Prelit Tree has become increasingly popular in the United States and Germany as well, most prelit trees are not made from recycled plastic materials because all prelit trees are being classified into the categories of electrical products and are subject to the mandatory regulations for the safety standards of electrical products e.g. UL, CSA, GS, BS and RoHS. Artificial Christmas trees may be "frosted" or "glittered" and designed for outdoor uses with UV additives."", ''Vinyl News Service'' (The Vinyl Institute), December 3, 2008, accessed December 15, 2008. Plastic trees can come in a variety of different colors, and one type came with built-in speakers and an MP3 player.
Companies such as Mountain King, Barcana and the National Tree Company have marketed increasingly realistic PVC trees made to closely resemble Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine or other common types of Christmas trees. During the 1990s trees not only began to appear more realistic but some also smelled more realistic. Many of these more modern models came with pre-strung lights and hinged branches which simply had to be snapped into position.
Trends in artificial tree consumption have constantly evolved and a number of designer and other types of artificial Christmas trees have appeared on the market. Fiber optic trees come in two major varieties, one resembles a traditional Christmas tree. The other type of fiber optic Christmas tree is one where the entire tree is made of wispy fiber optic cable, a tree composed entirely of light.Neer, Katherine. "", ''howstuffworks.com'', December 2006, accessed December 15, 2008. David Gutshall, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, received a patent for the latter type of fiber optic tree in 1998.Chartrand, Sabra.

Artificial trees became increasingly popular during the late 20th century. Users of artificial Christmas trees assert that they are more convenient, and, because they are reusable, much cheaper than their natural alternative. Between 2001 and 2007 artificial Christmas tree sales jumped from 7.3 million to 17.4 million.Hayes, Sharon Caskey.

Twelve years later, a 2004 ABC News/''Washington Post'' poll revealed that 58 percent of U.S. residents used an artificial tree instead of a natural tree.Langer, Gary.

The rise in popularity of artificial trees did not go unnoticed by the Christmas tree farming industry in the United States. In 2004, the U.S. Christmas tree industry hired the advertising agency Smith-Harroff to spearhead an ad campaign aimed at rejuvenating lagging sales of natural trees. --> A 1975 poll by Michigan State University showed the reasons why consumers were beginning to prefer artificial over natural Christmas trees.<ref name=marling/> The reasons included safety, one-time purchasing, and environmental responsibility but the biggest reason respondents gave pollsters was no messy needle clean up.<ref name=marling/>
Most artificial Christmas trees are manufactured in the Pearl River delta area in China. Promoters of artificial trees highlight them as convenient, reusable, and of better quality than artificial trees of old.

In the past, lead was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but it is now banned by Chinese laws.  Most PVC materials for making artificial Christmas trees are now using tin as a stabilizer in recent years.  PVC was used in some of the 2007 recalled Chinese toys. A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major health risks to young children are present.Maas, Richard P. et al. ''Artificial Christmas trees: how real are the lead exposure risks?'' ( via PubMed) ''Journal of Environmental Health'', December 2004; 67(5): 20&ndash;4, 32, accessed December 15, 2008. The lead author of the 2004 study, Dr. Richard Maas, noted in 2005: "We found that if we leave one of these trees standing for a week, and we wipe under the tree we   ll find large amounts of lead dust in many cases under the tree"."", ''WSBTV'' (Atlanta), November 29, 2005, accessed December 15, 2008.
In 2007, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) asked the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate lead levels in Chinese imported artificial trees.

The report determined that of the 50 million artificial trees in the United States approximately 20 million were 9 or more years old, the point where dangerous lead contamination levels are reached.Levin, Ronnie, et al.
