The '''Caecilii Metellii''' was one of the most important and wealthiest families in the Roman Republic. Although plebeians (meaning not of patrician stock), the Caecilii Metelli were nobles. The Caecilii Metellii remained a political power within the state, from the 3rd century BC to the end of the Republic, holding every office in the cursus honorum as well as several important military commands.
