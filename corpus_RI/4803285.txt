Boss Media was founded in 1996, with the initial corporate aim to operate Gold Club Casino, which it launched in 1997.  Soon after the online casino was launched, the company received requests from investors and companies interested in purchasing Boss Media's casino software. Boss Media's main focus thereby transferred to the creation of complete Internet casino solutions for clients.
Boss Media's corporate focus has since shifted to the creation of customised e-gaming systems for several gaming corporations. Boss Media's solutions are tailored to the unique needs of each client and based on innovative casino, poker, bingo and lottery applications for multiple digital distribution channels. Boss Media sold its own Internet casino in February 2004 to focus entirely on the e-gaming solutions it develops for clients. Boss Media now provides e-gaming solutions  for  online casino operators including bwin and Sportingbet.
Boss Media AB, in partnership with St Minver Ltd of Gibraltar, manages the International Poker Network, the platform for over 35 poker rooms.
In May 2007, the International Poker Network partnered with Yahoo! UK in launching Yahoo! Poker.
This is seen as a response from Yahoo! UK to the increasing demands of its expanding audience for an entertaining product within a safe playing environment. This new service offers a flash-only, browser-based design that requires no download. The International Poker Network supports a multi language format with the following languages available; English, Spanish, Greek, French, German, Italian, Turkish and Russian. It also accepts a number of currencies including euro, U.S. dollar, British pound and Turkish lira.
Boss Media acquired '''Dynamite Idea''' of England in April 2008. Dynamite Idea was founded in 1995, at that time specialising in graphic and web design, but became a developer of fixed odds and skill-based betting games, interactive television and fixed odds betting terminal games.
