The '''Norwalk/Sante Fe Springs Metrolink Station''' is a Metrolink rail station in the city of Norwalk, California.  It is served by Metrolink's 91 Line from Los Angeles Union Station to Riverside and  Metrolink's Orange County Line running from Los Angeles Union Station to Oceanside.  On weekdays, this station is served by 18 Orange County Line trains and nine 91 Line trains.  On weekends, six Orange County Line trains serve this station.  There is no 91 Line service on weekends.
Norwalk Transit operates a connector shuttle bus service between the Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs Transportation Center and the Metro Green Line Studebaker station in Norwalk. The rail feeder service implemented by Norwalk Transit provides direct interconnectivity between rail stations (Metrolink     commuter rail and Metro Green light rail).
There have been persistent proposals for an 2.5 mile eastward extension of the Metro Green Line from its current terminus of Norwalk Station to reach the Metrolink Station at Norwalk. This project carries a proposed cost of 321 million dollars for an aerial bridge, and a 360 million dollar cost for a subway. Since an initial Environmental Impact Review (EIR) 1993, there has been no solid progress for this proposal. The 2001 Los Angeles County Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) lists funding priorities to build through year 2025. The Green Line east extension is not a funded project in the MTA LRTP and is unlikely to receive funding under this plan.
