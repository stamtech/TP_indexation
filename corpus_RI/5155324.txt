Al-Qazwini initiated his higher religious studies in Qum, Iran where he was awarded with a B.A. and M.A. in Islamic Studies in 1985.  During 1987-1989 he served as professor of Islamic Studies at the Islamic seminary in Damascus, Syria. From 1989-1994 he contributed as associated imam and professor of Islamic Studies at several Islamic centers and foundations in London, England.
Shortly after his arrival in California in 1994, Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini became the founder and director of the Islamic Cultural Center of San Diego, California.  This center was the first Shia mosque established in San Diego County for religious and social events.  The success of this mosque in San Diego enabled him to found another mosque in Orange County, California.
In September 1996, he founded the Islamic Educational Center of Orange County (IECOC), drawing on his experience in Islamic Studies. As of 2009, the IECOC has become an active community center.
Al-Qazwini's past associations have included: being chairman of the Development and World Events Committee of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California (an umbrella organization for sixty-four mosques and Islamic centers), a board member of the council of Shia Muslim scholars of North America. For the past six years he has co-chaired the West Coast Dialogue of Muslims and Catholics, and has been an advisor for the United Muslim American Association for six years. He spends much of his time lecturing across the world and nationally at churches, universities and on panels with other parishioners. Al-Qazwini is married and has five children and two grandchildren.
