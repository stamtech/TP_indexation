The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At the 39th Grammy Awards, No Doubt earned nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Album. The album has sold over 20&nbsp;million copies worldwide; and was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. It helped to initiate the ska revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them to attract more mainstream attention. The album was ranked number 441 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
No Doubt embarked on a tour to promote the album. It was designed by Project X and lasted two and a half years. An early 1997 performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim was filmed and released as ''Live in the Tragic Kingdom'' on VHS and later DVD.
No Doubt released its debut album ''No Doubt'' in 1992, a year after being signed to Interscope. The album's pop-oriented sound sharply contrasted with grunge music, a genre which was very popular at the time in the United States. |title= No Doubt&nbsp;> Overview |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |author=Bush, John |publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> The album sold 30,000 copies;<ref name="ocw">{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/music/tunes-and-toons/23963/ |title= Tunes and 'Toons |accessdate=August 31, 2008 |author=Vineyard, Jennifer |date=February 26, 1998 |publisher=''OC Weekly''}}</ref><ref name="band">{{cite web |url=http://www.nodoubt.com/band/ |title=Timeline |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=No Doubt official website}}</ref> in the words of the program director of KROQ, a California radio station on which it was one of the band's driving ambitions to be played: "It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio."<ref name="band"/><ref name=time>{{cite journal |last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |date=April 10, 2000 |title=Two-Hit Wonders |journal=Time |volume=155 |issue=14 |pages=Visions 21 |publisher=Time, Inc. |location=Chicago |issn=0040-781X |oclc=7411621 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,42351,00.html}} Retrieved on May 3, 2007.</ref>
No Doubt began work on its second album in 1993, but Interscope rejected most of the material, which was written by Gary Angle,|title = No Doubt > Biography|accessdate = August 7, 2009|publisher = Allmusic}}</ref> and paired the band with producer Matthew Wilder.

The band decided to produce their next album independently and recorded their second album, ''The Beacon Street Collection'', in a homemade studio. No Doubt's first two singles were released for ''The Beacon Street Collection'': "Squeal" and "Doghouse", under their own record label, Beacon Street Records. Despite limited availability, the album sold 100,000 copies in the year of its release. Their independence attracted Interscope's attention and ensured that they would fund a third album.
The album is named after the nickname Dumont's 7th grade teacher had for Disneyland, which is in Anaheim, California, where the band members grew up. It is a pun on the popular nickname for Disneyland   "The Magic Kingdom". The album photography and portraits were taken by photographer fine artist Daniel Arsenault. Gwen is featured in the foreground while the rest of the band members are standing in an orange grove in the background. Gwen pushed for Eric to be included on the album cover   a source of tension for the band   reasoning that although he had left the band, he had still contributed substantially to the album. Eric is seen near the back of the picture, looking away from the camera. The pictures on the cover and in the liner notes were taken on California city streets and in orange groves. The red dress Gwen wears on the cover was loaned to the Hard Rock Cafe and was later displayed at the Fullerton Museum Center in an exhibit titled "The Orange Groove: Orange County's Rock n' Roll History". The dress, appraised as high as US$5,000, was stolen from the exhibit in January 2005.
Many of the lyrics on ''Tragic Kingdom'' were written by lead vocalist Gwen Stefani, and were about her experiences in life. Those from ''No Doubt'' and ''The Beacon Street Collection'' were written mainly by Eric Stefani, who left the band after ''Tragic Kingdom'' was finished. Therefore, the style of music changed from what the band had previously produced. Guitarist Tom Dumont explained the change in sound in an interview for Backstage Online:
We have a simpler style. We're not quite genius like him I think. This album was our first attempt. It was Gwen's first time really writing all the lyrics herself so to me, it went the opposie  from selling out we have done something that is even more personal. In the past, Eric was writing songs about his life and having Gwen sing them. Now we have Gwen singing and writing about her own experiences. It makes it more natural. She's a singer, she should sing about herself or sing what she wants to sing. I think that is the main reason why our musical style has changed.}}
The first single released from ''Tragic Kingdom'' was "Just a Girl", which details Gwen Stefani's exasperation with female stereotypes and her father's concerned reaction to her driving home late from her boyfriend's house. It peaked at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and 10 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song also charted on the UK Singles Chart, where its original release peaked at number 38 and its re-issue at number three.
 The song was not eligible to chart on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 because no commercial single was released, which was a requirement at the time. The song also peaked on Modern Rock Tracks at number two, the Adult Contemporary chart, where it peaked at number six, the Adult Top 40, where it hit number one and the Rhythmic Top 40, where it hit number nine. The song also appeared on many international charts. In February 1997, it reached number one in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand. It also reached number four in France and Finland.
In May 1996, the band worked with HMV, MuchMusic, and the Universal Music Group to put on a global in-store promotion. The band performed and answered questions in MuchMusic's studios in Toronto, Ontario. The session was broadcast live to HMV stores worldwide and on a webcast so that fans could watch and ask the band questions through MuchMusic's VJs. Sales of ''Tragic Kingdom'' doubled the week after the event. The event's sponsors lobbied ''Guinness World Records'' to create a category for the largest virtual in-store promotion to recognize the event.
The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave a mostly positive review, describing ''Tragic Kingdom'' as "ear candy with good beats, not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars" and its music as "a spry, white-suburban take on ska and Blondieesque pop". Fricke however described "Don't Speak" as "irritating swill" with "high-pitched rippling" from Gwen Stefani. In 2003, the album was ranked number 441 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine gave the album a C+ rating. Reviewer David Browne attributed the album's sales to Gwen Stefani's "leggy, bleached-blond calling card" and concluded that "sex still sells". Browne, however, described the music as "a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and Chili Peppers-style white-boy funk, with dashes of reggae, squealing hair-metal guitar, disco, ska-band horns" and the band as sounding like "savvy, lounge-bred pros". Individual songs were singled out and commented on: "Just a Girl" was described as "a chirpy, ska-tinged bopper", "Don't Speak" as "an old-fangled power ballad", "Sixteen" as a "song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls", and "Spiderwebs" and "End It on This" as " acknowledg obsessions with losers and tr to break free."
Calling the album a marked improvement over "the diffuse, rambling songwriting of  two previous CDs", ''Los Angeles Times'' critic Mike Boehm felt that on the album, "The band is bright, hard-hitting and kinetic, as sharp production captures the core, four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best".Boehm, Mike. "'Kingdom' Is Band's Best Yet, No Doubt". ''Los Angeles Times''. November 13, 1995. In a favourable review for ''The Village Voice'', critic Chuck Eddy felt that although " turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance new-wave guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper". Allmusic called it "pure fun" and described the music as something "between '90s punk, third-wave ska, and pop sensibility" and a mix of "new wave melodicism, post-grunge rock, and West Coast sunshine", indicating the songs "Spiderwebs", "Just a Girl", and "Don't Speak" as "positively  the airwaves". |title=Tragic Kingdom&nbsp;> Review |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> Yahoo!

No Doubt embarked on the Tragic Kingdom Tour after the release of the album. It chose Project X, headed by Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling, to design the stage. No Doubt suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as "a very kinetic performance". The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years.
An early 1997 performance at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim was filmed and was released as ''Live in the Tragic Kingdom'' on video cassette on November 11, 1997. It was re-released on November 25, 2003 on DVD as part of the box set ''Boom Box'', which also contained ''The Singles 1992   2003'', ''Everything in Time'', and ''The Videos 1992   2003''; and again on June 13, 2006 as a single DVD, containing bonus material of extra songs, a photo gallery, and an alternate version of "Don't Speak".
During 2009, No Doubt set out to do what was thought to be a tour for the followers of their older albums. As it turns out, No Doubt used this as means to debut new songs. The Sounds and Paramore toured with the band.
