Mitchell was born in Madisonville, Kentucky to "Cowboy" Louie, who had quite a bit of fame as a performer, and Paulette Mitchell.
Mitchell grew up in Huron, Tennessee, a small town just north east of Memphis.  In 1998, Tonya was performing country music at a regional benefit for St. Jude's Hospital when Justin Timberlake's grandfather, Bill Bomar, heard the young teen sing.  Excited by her voice, the man approached Tonya and introduced himself.  He told Tonya that Justin was his grandson and that he could help her break into the music industry.
Tonya did not think much about this but later it led to her signing with Justin Timberlake's management company, JustinTime Entertainment and being managed by Justin's mother, Lynn Harless.  Tonya was later signed to Universal Records and entered the studio to record her twelve-song debut album.
On February 27, 2001, a few weeks after recording her album, Mitchell's first single, "Broken Promises" hit the radio stations.  The song reached #36 on Radio & Records' CHR/Pop tracks chart and peaked at #17 on the  in late April.  Following the release of the single, Mitchell released her debut solo album, "I Represent", on April 10, 2001.
In 2001, Tonya was asked to be one of the opening acts for the NSYNC Pop Odyssey Tour.  This helped Tonya's career as she began making appearances at venues and performing in front of audiences of fifty thousand plus.  Mitchell shared the stage with some of the world's biggest acts today which included: Nelly, Boys II Men, Lil Romeo, Dreamand Tyrese.
After the tour ended, Mitchell performed at various radio shows throughout the United States, including a performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
In July 2001, Tonya's father, Cowboy Louie Mitchell, died.  Following the heartache of losing her father, Tonya was dropped from Universal Records.  She decided to step away from the recording industry to spend time with her family.
