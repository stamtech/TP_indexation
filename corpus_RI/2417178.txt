LUTW is affiliated with the University of Calgary, Canada.
To date, lighting has been provided to more than 14,000 homes in 26 countries, such as Sri Lanka and South Africa.
LUTW uses a combination of white LED (WLED) lights or LED lamps and a source of renewable energy, typically solar cells but alternatively person powered pedal generators, micro hydro or small wind turbines. (The website uses the terms "pico hydro" and "pico wind turbines", implying extremely small scale.) The solar cells are suitable for providing electricity in remote areas, while the LED lights are chosen for their efficiency, durability, and relatively low cost. The efficiency of the lights means that relatively small solar panels are needed, reducing the capital cost.
There is currently a movement towards the implementation of CFLs (compact fluorescent lighting) as it has been determined to be far more efficient than white LEDs (WLEDs) with recent technology advances. LUTW has recently been discussing the benefits of biogas and is looking into the future of it.
Regarding wind turbins referred to above, consider using Wind Power Density (WPD) calculations to determine that the particular location has wind characteristics that will support economical production of wind power energy. For a further definition of WPD, refer to "Location" section of "Wind Farm" in Wikipedia. 
The LUTW website cites a Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory paper, which argues that replacing kerosene lamps with LED Lamps helps reduce greenhouse gases. The paper says:
