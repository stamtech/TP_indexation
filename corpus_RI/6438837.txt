If you have Microsoft Word on your computer, go to it. Have the '''styles and formating'''='''normal''', '''Font''' has to be times '''Times New Roman''', and font size need to be '''12'''. Now go to edit mode on your talk page and copy and paste it to the Microsoft Word Document start at the Big Island Kings'' down to before the ''If''. (The Big Island Kings might turn out a little off.) 
When it reaches Kepookalani, is the main part of the family tree. I didn't center it so if you like you could.
I am planning to edit this tree to the House of Kalakaua article. I need your help. You can see why; look at this thing I made. I think I prefer the  rather than a better version of this chart. This is really complicated because of all the intermarriages between the alii of Hawaii.
If you are really confused, I can write the entire tree into words, so you can have a visual and written reference. Just ask. 
Here are the sites/book that are my reference:
If you can't create one, could you ask if anyone other User would create one. If you can create a family tree, I will have three more ready for you in a while about the House of Kamehameha, Kawananakoa, and Keoua Nui.
One last tip, tried copy and pasting instead of spelling words out because the Merina Monarchs got change to the Merrie Monarchs.  ( ) 05:29, 20 May 2008 (UTC)
This took me hours to make, and I am still not finished. See the dash to the right of Ka'akauawao that is suppose to be the line leading up to the Mauian kings but I am confused on how to finis it.
I simply am unable to use the ASCII link you gave me to make your desired format that uses the symbol Husband               Wife. It took me hours to make half of it and still I can't finish it. I constantly have to edit and save and edit and save. I sorry. This is only on Wikipedia that is, I could probably use your desire format on Microsoft. If you want me to I will
I hope this addresses you about the marriage and lack of geneology knowlegde.  Here I'll just give the marriages in by placing the equal signs. I am concern how the tree will show the sex of the aliis.
Bottom to top.

Hope this help and please don't tell me you don't understand the parent to children format. Ask me again if you need help. Oh take a look at this  and click on the family tree. If you think making this tree is hard, think again.
