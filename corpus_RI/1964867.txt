The new Tournament format was also used for the preliminary events, each a different variety of poker game.  The preliminary events were also freeze-out tournaments (although rebuy tournaments were added in later years).
There were 6 entrants to the main event. Each paid $5,000 to enter the tournament.  The game played was No Limit Texas Hold 'em.
Johnny Moss's victory this year, was the first time a player had been awarded the Main Event Championship two years in a row.  A title that would later be shared by Doyle Brunson, Stu Ungar, and Johnny Chan.
