The Twin Lakes Brewing Company was founded in Greenville, Delaware in April, 2006.
We are an AmericanFarmBrewery.com and use only the finest ingredients: whole flower hops, the best grains, cultured brewer   s yeast, and most exceptionally, water from the artesian spring were our founding father George Washington drank and rested. Our 25 barrel, steam-fired, gravity-fed, five vessel brew house and tasting room is a converted art studio and tractor barn at the historic Twin Lakes Farm (est. 1826) in Greenville, Delaware.  This historic 252 acre farm, nestled in the beauty and rich heritage of Delaware   s Brandywine Valley , has been in the family for seven generations, making Twin Lakes a long standing good neighbor and member of the community.  We believe our American farm brewery and its exceptional beer are part of what makes Delaware and the surrounding historical region so special.
The Twin Lakes Brewing Company produces approximately 3,000 barrels of beer per year. In celebration of their 5th Anniversary the brewery installed a canning line and now produces 12oz cans. The Brewery recognizes the line as an extension of their draft/keg business and refers to the can as a BabyKeg. See www.BabyKeg.comSee www.CraftDraftCan.com 
Twin Lakes Brewery installed a 2 kilowatt solar energy panels and their plans include making the entire brewery completely energy independent in the near future.
There are upcoming plans for a small hydroelectric generator running in the upper of the two lakes and more solar panels will be going in,    We   re proud that Route 52 is the first scenic byway in the State of Delaware and we want to protect the heritage and environment here.
