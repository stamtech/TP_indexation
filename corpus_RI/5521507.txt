Used cell phones are a growing electronic waste challenge. On average, American cell phone subscribers replace their cell phones every 18 months. In the U.S., between 100 million and 130 million cell phones are thrown away each year, representing an estimated 65,000 tons of electronics waste. ReCellular collects cell phones for resale and recycling, collecting more than 125,000 phones each week.
Founded in 1991, ReCellular is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
ReCellular has built a network of nearly 1,100 collection partners, representing nearly 40,000 collection sites across the nation, including:
Many organizations use the proceeds from their wireless recycling programs to benefit charitable causes. ReCellular partners raised $4.0 million for non-profit programs in 2008, and more than $20 million for charities since 1996. 
Approximately half of the phones ReCellular collects are reprogrammed and sold for reuse. 
Obsolete or non-functional phones are dismantled and recycled to reclaim valuable materials, such as: gold, silver and palladium from circuit boards; copper wiring from phone chargers; nickel, iron, cadmium and lead from battery packs; and plastic from cases and accessories. ReCellular   s zero-waste policy dictates that all donated materials are recycled, including cardboard, paper and plastic shipping materials     diverting more than 1 million pounds of materials from landfills per year. 
In November 2006, the magazine ''Inc.'' named ReCellular to the Green 50.
ReCellular also offers a Cell Phone Data Eraser tool that enables consumers to remove personal information from their old cell phones prior to recycling.
