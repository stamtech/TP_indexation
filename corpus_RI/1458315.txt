Although the original fantasy setting of Chaos was replaced with a science fiction setting and the graphics were slightly improved, the rules remained almost unchanged.
The two most important improvements were the integrated chat box and the ability to play the game online.
Each turn a player is able to select a monster or item to send down. Each monster or item had a specific percentage of working.
During the game each player is given an amount of time to move their commander and units to attack and destroy the enemy.
In this way play continues until all other commanders have been defeated and one remains.
Games Domain was a very popular site owned by BTOpenworld, 'The GamesDomain Castle' was its primary source of visitors..
On October 31, 2003, the domain name was sold to Yahoo as part of BT's strategy to re-brand the BT Openworld service to consumer friendly 'BT Yahoo Broadband'.
Shortly afterwards, Yahoo terminated the 'Castle' without warning, and made radical changes to the site that caught visitors by surprise.
Almost immediately, forums popped up across the Internet, full of people trying to find their favourite site, and upon hearing the truth, turned their anger towards Yahoo. 
Petitions soon cropped up to bring the Castle back yet nothing became of it.
Recently a European programmer, Matlu, attempted to completely re-make Cyber Wars.
The new game, re-named ''Cyber Battles'', became popular with previous players and slowly developed a fan base, though has recently slipped into decline, suffering from empty servers and lack of attention.
Spriters have improved upon the graphics and, together with the new programming, game play has been tweaked. For example, the original version would crash or freeze if a commander was killed a certain way, but this no longer occurs. Many other bugs have likewise been fixed.
