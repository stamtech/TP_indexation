Delete as there is no such thing. While most internal and external combustion engines run on "fossil fuels," they do not need to, by definition. People have been able to power ICE vehicles with alternative fuels. Steam engines that burn coal can be powered with non-fossil fuels.   ( ) 21:35, 5 June 2010 (UTC)

No mention of "Vango" at target article. Vango are a well-known manufacturer of tents and related equipment, and nothing to do with the current target.   ( ) 16:38, 5 June 2010 (UTC)
Delete. Redirect doesn't appear to have any connection with its target and was created by banned User:Mac. One incoming link from a dab page (which I'm about to remove) and one from an article that looks like a great candidate for AfD. If kept, the curly apostrophe in the title may be a problem.   |   16:21, 5 June 2010 (UTC)
Nominating for deletion under criterion 9: "If the redirect could plausibly be expanded into an article, and the target article contains little information on the subject. In these cases, it is better that the target article contain a redlink pointing back to the redirect." The article Liquidity trap  does not contain anything about the concept of "helicopter money" as defined by Milton Friedman, and this concept is only tangentially related to the liquidity trap. I therefore suggest this redirect be deleted until an article on the concept of "helicopter money" can be created, or a section can be written in another article which would then be a more appropriate redirect target.

Strange, random and implausible redirect                    09:49, 5 June 2010 (UTC)
The redirect List of Sri Lankan Tamils should be deleted so that List of Tamils of Sri Lanka can be moved to List of Sri Lankan Tamils--  ( ) 09:34, 5 June 2010 (UTC)
Redirects to Photovoltaic engineering in Australia because, as far as I can tell, Solar power in Australia has a brief mention that solar panels were once used as a sound barrier along a highway. I suppose we could change target to Solar power in Australia, but this is so tenuous I wonder if it shouldn't be done away with all together.   ( ) 02:39, 5 June 2010 (UTC)
