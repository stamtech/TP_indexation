In the 1997 Pro Tour Chicago, Boeken finished in 15th place, and later 32nd at Pro Tour Mainz. He went on to win the 2000 European Championship and $11,500.
After his early success in his Magic career he started playing poker.
Like fellow Magic player David Williams, Boeken credits Marcel Luske as his mentor.
Boeken's first major finish in the money was at the 2003 Master Classics of Poker, where he finished 4th in the    200 no limit hold'em event. 8 months later he played in the $10,000 no limit hold'em championship of Festa al Lago II in Las Vegas, Nevada where he again finished in the money.
In October 2004, both Boeken and Luske made the final table of the European Poker Tour (EPT) event in London won by John Shipley. Boeken made a second EPT final table in January 2005 at the Scandinavian Open in Copenhagen where he defeated Ram Vaswani in the final heads-up confrontation.
Boeken attended the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in 2005 and finished in the money twice, including at the final table of the $2,500 limit hold'em event.
Boeken won the 2006 British Poker Open beating the likes of Gus Hansen and collecting 50,000 GBP.
As of 2010, Boeken's total live tournament winnings exceed $1,100,000.
Boeken plays online poker as ''Exclusive'' at PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker. He is a member of the ''Team PokerStars'' group of sponsored players.
In 2007 Boeken and Marcel Luske started a television show called ''Veronica Poker'' where famous Dutch people learned poker from them. Eventually the famous people had to play against each other, with the winner invited to an important tournament in Las Vegas. A second TV show with Boeken and Luske started in February 2007. The show is called "Poker Kings NL" and airs on the Tien channel. The show follows both Boeken and Luske while they travel around the world, attending poker tournaments.
