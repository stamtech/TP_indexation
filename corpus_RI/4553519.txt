MyBlogLog communities revolved around an individual blog registered by that blog's author. These communities had anywhere from a few to thousands of members. Communities that are particularly popular, had the most members or that are brand new were featured on the MyBlogLog Communities page. Members can also find communities via searches for key words or tags.
MyBlogLog members were displayed and searchable in a largely similar fashion to MyBlogLog communities. Featured, popular and new members were displayed on the MyBlogLog members page. Users could also search for members and get a sense of who they were by seeing which communities they were a member of and what tags have been associated to their profile by the MyBlogLog community.
MyBlogLog was originally developed by Cloudspace&mdash; an Orlando, Florida web applications development shop. It was acquired in January, 2007 by Yahoo for slightly more than $10 million and with over 45,000 blogs subscribed at the time.
On the 24th February 2011 Yahoo announced the MyBlogLog service would be terminated on May 24, 2011.
