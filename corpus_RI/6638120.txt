Ken Tucker of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' gave the album two out of four stars and described its music as "fairly conventional pop rhythms attractively crooned", but complimented its "odd influence  'Little Walter', derives its melody from the old Ramsey Lewis pop-jazz instrumental hit 'Wade in the Water'".Tucker, Ken (May 1, 1988). .

Joe Brown of ''The Washington Post'' found the group's voices "impressive" and stated "while their very basic harmonizing over the spartan drum-machine patterns on 'Baby Doll' and 'For the Love of You' are probably serviceable on the dance floor, they'd be deadly dull from a concert seat".
In a retrospective review, Allmusic editor Ron Wynn viewed that the group "made a quick and lasting impact with" the album, particularly with its single "Little Walter", stating "It proved a huge R&B hit and got moderate pop attention, and it helped establish the trio and their creative mix of vintage soul and contemporary hip-hop and new jack production".Wynn, Ron (August 1, 2003). . Allmusic. Retrieved on 2011-06-17. ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'' noted the group's "wit" on tracks such as "Little Walter" and "Born Not to Know", but added that "these moments are so pointed they leave the disc's love ballads sounding flat".''Rolling Stone'' (2004), p. 818. Yahoo! Music's Scott Wilson stated "A very solid debut, with the groundwork for what would follow, but they're just getting their bearings. Did spawn a number one R&B hit with 'Little Walter', but not the juggernauts their later work would be".Wilson, Scott (January 1, 2000). . Yahoo! Music. Archived from  on 2011-06-17.
