A 2003 book by Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'n Bitch : The Knitter's Handbook'', sold almost 200,000 copies in the first six months of publication. The book states that Debbie Stoller founded New York City's first Stitch 'N Bitch knitting group.  In January 2004, Newsweek reported that Stoller's New York group had inspired spin-offs in Chicago and Los Angeles.
From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a trademark dispute.
In June 2005, Sew Fast/Sew Easy filed a trademark application for ''Stitch & Bitch'' to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application is suspended. In fall 2005, due to letters claiming trademark infringement from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with CafePress.com were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase "Stitch 'n Bitch". Local groups that communicated with each other through Yahoo! Groups were similarly forced to remove "Stitch 'n Bitch" from the name and description of their group.  Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB.
In May 2004, Stoller made four trademark applications regarding the term ''Stitch 'N Bitch'':
In July 2005, these four trademark applications were denied
In February 2006 a website was started at the internet address freetostitchfreetobitch.org, calling for a boycott on Sew Fast/Sew Easy.
In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement, and all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered.
