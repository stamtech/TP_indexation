The '''Motorola Rival A455''' is a Verizon Wireless cell phone launched in June 2009. The phone was a pocket-friendly slider with full QWERTY keyboard for fast messaging; and also features touch screen multimedia.  The cell phone comes in Tin Silver and Purple.
The phone has a relatively long battery life lasting up to three days without being charged. This phone has also been known to be very delicate and personally not recommended if you want a tough phone.
It is not all touch screen with only a couple features that are touch; the rest are controlled manually by buttons on the phone. A few of the touch features include the pop up dial pad, and the contact search option.
The Motorola Rival A455 is on the Telus and Koodo wireless networks in Canada and the Verizon wireless network in the United States.It is also available in Open Mobile in  the Caribbean
