Flaton won a World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in 1983 in the $1,000 seven-card stud event. He also finished in the money of the $10,000 no limit hold'em main event in 1986 (28th), 1988 (23rd), 1990 (31st), and 1997 (18th). 
Flaton also won the 1996 United States Poker Championship and competed in the World Poker Tour (WPT).
Both Flaton and his peers have suggested that seven-card stud was his best game.
Flaton died in November 2004 at Rose Dominican Hospitals (Siena Campus), aged 64. He died of a heart attack, although he was suffering from lung cancer at the time, despite being a non-smoker.  He is survived by his wife Crystal and son Aaron. Flaton often kept an up-to-date picture of Aaron with him when playing in poker tournaments.
His total live tournament winnings were at least $2,500,000. His 38 cashes at the WSOP accounted for $561,025 of his lifetime winnings.
Flaton got his nickname, ''Skyhawk'', when Stu Ungar, after seeing Flaton spread his arms and then rake in the pot while in a poker tournament,  commented that Flaton "swooped down on piles of chips like a 'skyhawk.' "
