Is there some way I can adjust the contrast, brightness etc. of the movie on WMP ?  &nbsp;  05:45, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
I am trying to make a circuit simulator using C++. Can anybody tell me if there are any libraries available that can do laplace transforms, using C++?   ( ) 06:39, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
I was surprised to find that even with the "no exceptions" option ticked, I could still see webpages. The help information says "When you select Don   t allow exceptions, you can still send and receive e-mail, use an instant messaging program, or view most Web pages"!
What would happen if I kept "no exceptions" ticked all the time? The only thing I do is surf the internet with Firefox, nothing else. Thanks   ( ) 15:43, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
Thanks, in summary does the above mean I can keep "no exceptions" ticked all the time without any problems, if I only do web browsing?   ( ) 20:05, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
For Father's Day, I decided to email Dad, who is contracting overseas. He didn't tell me where he was located, so I went to the "Show Original" section of his message sent to me and tried to copy/paste these IP addresses onto the ARIN WHOIS search. It keeps returning IANA, from Marina Del Rey, CA. (I see something about a "BLACKHOLE" in that listing, as well.)
Not being satisfied by IANA, because MDR is obviously not where Dad is, I need extra help here.
Now, as the entire "SHOW ORIGINAL" view would be too overbearingly full of raw text to show you, I'll just paste all the unknown IPs I was able to sift out of the message:
Received: by '''10.216.160.8''' with SMTP id t8cs47884wek;
Received: by '''10.224.44.102''' with SMTP id z38mr2274034qae.32.1277030491302;
Received: from web63405.mail.re1.yahoo.com (web63405.mail.re1.yahoo.com {'''69.147.97.45'''})
Received-SPF: pass (google.com: best guess record for domain of ''(redacted email address)'' designates 69.147.97.45 as permitted sender) client-ip='''69.147.97.45''';
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; spf=pass (google.com: best guess record for domain of ''(redacted email address)'' designates '''69.147.97.45''' as permitted sender) smtp.mail=''(redacted email address)''; dkim=pass (test mode) header.i=@yahoo.com
Now, I just did a search on that 69.147.xx.xx IP and it was of the server that processed Dad's email. What's left is that 10.216.xxx.x IP and the 10.224.xx.xxx IP. What other ways can you think of that'll help me find where Dad is just from those two IPs, and that will not turn up IANA/MDR again? Also, when you search for those two IPs in a different way, how did you, and what results did they turn up this time? 
Thanks, --      18:51, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
I decided to put off the previous project I mentioned here and try something else.  What is the simplest possible way of:
I'm using Windows XP, with Microsoft Visual C++.  I'm reading Microsoft's documentation on waveform generation, and I'll understand it eventually, but I don't need anything that elaborate.  --  ( ) 19:45, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
How can I go from something like the title to a string in Python? I don't know what the representation is called, so I'm having trouble finding resources.   ( ) 22:05, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
