Southern Vectis have a total of 93 buses in their fleet used for regular services. These include single deck buses, double deck buses, open top buses, and coaches, normally used for school routes or driver training. Including ancillary and other vehicles such as road trains, their total fleet is 103. Buses have either been bought new or been transferred from other bus companies, normally fellow Go-Ahead bus companies such as Bluestar or Wilts & Dorset. Southern Vectis are currently in the process of replacing older step-entrance buses with low-floor buses. This process is expected to be complete by Summer 2009.
Southern Vectis currently own one kind of this bus, which is numbered 625 it was previously operating with Marchwood Motorways when it was transferred to Southern Vectis.
It  was used for a time being on a route as a spare whilst they were waiting for DAF 265 to become available. But plans changed and 625 was taken off the route leaving solos 2632 and 2631 to take over. It is planned to have 625 part of the open top fleet during the summer taking over the duties of some of the ex roadtrains.
During 2010 1 DAF SB220 was transferred from Bluestar to the coach fleet after being displaced from Bluestar's fleet due to recent influx of Citaros. Southern Vectis plan to use one for upcoming school contracts and other work like the festival and special events it is registered T165 AUA and was given fleet number 265.
One of the DAF's 265 is currently in Newport Depot Bodyshop after an accident during the recent December Ice and Snow whilst still operating with Bluestar. The plan for it is for it to be repaired and put into Southern Vectis Best Impressions Green and then used for coach duties and route 25. Due to it taken longer than expect Optare Solos 2631 & 2632 now take turns on the route.
Southern Vectis currently own two types of Darts. In 2002, a new Plaxton Mini Pointer Dart was the first bus in the fleet to feature a low floor/kneeling entrance, a public address system, CCTV and LED destination displays, at the front, rear, and left-hand side, and was delivered in the Oxford blue livery. 
To cope with the increase in services after a network change, a further 14 were delivered in 2005 and were painted in the 2005 two-tone green livery. 2006 saw two more transferred from Solent Blue Line, in the 2006 two-tone green livery, the first of the single deck buses in this livery. Following more Solent Blue Line services revisions, four more MPDs were transferred in February 2008. The first entered service in early April 2008, and on the first journey got stuck trying to access Cowes Pontoon on route 1, because the steering lock had not been changed from when it was with Solent Blue Line. However four of the six in total from Solent Blue Line later left the fleet for Wilts and Dorset with a further six leaving after service revisions on 20 December 2009.
A number of ex-London buses (including some from London United) have also been owned over the years.
In January 2007 Southern Vectis ordered seven Euro V-engined Mercedes-Benz Citaros and were new to the island in June to upgrade route 9 and were fleet numbered 451-457. The investment was worth   1 million,  with buses costing 150,000 each.
These types of buses are widely used within the Go-Ahead Group, with Go North East, Oxford Bus Company, Solent Blue Line and Wilts & Dorset all operating the type but were new to Southern Vectis being the longest ever single deck bus owned by the company, at  and the first full size single deck bus bought since 1976. They were bought exclusively for use on route 9 from Newport to Ryde and were the first buses in the fleet with air conditioning and Euro V engines. The purchase of these buses made Southern Vectis one of the first in the UK to purchase Euro V engines, the greenest engine standard. This was for implemented across the UK in 2009.
In April 2008, the MOT of one of the buses discovered that buses 451 and 452 were wearing the wrong registrations plates, they had been from new. To match the chassis number, they were switched round.
For the 2009 frequency increase on route 9, from six to eight buses an hour from April, in March Southern Vectis acquired a further two nearly new Citaros from within Go South Coast. These were two 2006 examples new to Wilts & Dorset but loaned to Enterprise for the Uni-link contract in Southampton from new. With the Uni-link contract awarded to Bluestar from September 2008, the buses passed to that company, where they soon transferred to Southern Vectis. The buses entered service with Wilts & Dorset seat moquette, with various places Wilts serve printed on the seats.
Whilst the Citaros were bought for route 9, when they were new they were used on Festival services before entering normal service. Citaros covered the C81 school service to Brockenhurst once or twice, and one was put on route 7 once to cover a broken down vehicle. From the timetable change of 30 August 2009, the 1845 weekday route 4 from Ryde has been scheduled to be a Citaro. Since then, Citaros have worked route 4 at other times as well, and most notably, because it would have been unable to run the full route, in November 2009 a Citaro ran route 1.
From the end of 2009 the seven Citaros bought new by Southern Vectis are being withdrawn from the fleet and transferred to Bluestar with buses on route 9 being replaced with double deckers. The two remaining numbered 479-480 will remain but no longer be restricted to run on route 9, with one serving route 4 and one serving route 5.
During October 2010, HF06FUA/FUB will be transferred to Go Ahead's North East for use on the 309/310 "Cobalt Clipper" Services and operations with some coaches cascading to Bluestar.
During November/December 2010 two Optare Solos which were displaced by Wilts & Dorset were transferred over to Southern Vectis set to replace the Mercedes Citaros 479 and 480. The planned routes for the solos were on Route 4 and 38.
Another two solos were added to the fleet during March 2011, to cope with Network Upgrades during April 2011. They were given fleet numbers 2618 & 2620.
The Solos are have a capacity of 30 and all have Hanover Destination Displays
There were originally 16 Leyland Olympians bought between 1989 and 1990 of which none remain in service. A further batch of nine Northern Counties bodied Olympians were bought in 1993. 742 and 743 are the only two which remain in service having been converted to open-top and allocated to the Needles Tour. On conversion to open top they were renumbered as 642 and 643. They are the longest serving current buses in the Southern Vectis fleet.
As part of the arrival of new Scania OmniCitys, the original Leyland-bodied Olympians were transferred to fellow Go South Coast companies Wilts & Dorset and Damory Coaches. The last vehicle to leave the island was 726, which appeared at the 2008 Isle of Wight bus museum running day. After the last Scania due (1109) arrived from a photo shoot with other Go South Coast OmniCitys, 726 transferred to the mainland. The only two Leyland Olympians to remain with Southern Vectis are two open-top buses.
Two batches of the Northern Counties bodied Volvo Olympians were bought new, seven in 1995 and eight in 1998. They have served through a variety of liveries, firstly the mushroom cream and green livery, then either 'Route Rouge' or the Island Explorer livery. With the arrival of the new Scania OmniCitys most of the Volvo Olympians were transferred to other operators. Five ex-Solent Blue Line vehicles converted for use as open-top vehicles by Southern Vectis also make up part of the fleet and are in the 'Island Breezer' livery. All Olympians were transferred to Wilts & Dorset/Damory during 2009/10.
During August 2010 13 East Lancs Olympians were transferred from Metrobus of Crawley after their final service on the 7th August 2010 they are all dual doored which will be retained. They will mainly be used on substantial new school contracts gained from Wightbus for the new school term in September 2010. All Olympians transferred from Metrobus & Go Ahead London have now received branding for Moss Motors on top of their previous livery. Most of them were used at the Summer Madness music concert which took place at Carisbrooke Castle during the end of August 2010.
A further 7 Northern Counties Palatine 2 Volvo Olympians were transferred from Go-Ahead London , they too will also retained their centre exits these will be also mainly used on substantial school contracts gained from Wightbus for the new school term in which began in September 2010.
A single open-top vehicle acquired from Wilts and Dorset in 2009 to replace three older open-top Bristol VRs still in the old Orange and Sunburst livery. Initially Southern Vectis planned to take delivery of three of these vehicles but a change in law meaning concessionary travel was no longer valid for tourist bus services resulted in fewer passengers, with fewer vehicles needed. In 2008, while with Wilts and Dorset, this particular vehicle was involved in an accident with a Porsche after crossing Sandbanks and heading towards Swanage and overturned trapping many passengers on board.
There were seven B7TLs bought new in 2002 and were originally in the Island Explorer blue livery. They were the first to be repainted to the new two-tone green livery. Some operated in service in all over lime green awaiting completion of their livery. In April 2007 offside branding of past headline Isle of Wight Festival acts were applied to the buses. From 2009, these began to be taken down and replaced with advertising boards as the vehicles received a repaint. Initially the plan was for all the vehicles to receive island-thinkers branding matching the Scanias but this decision was later reversed and only one vehicle, 191, has island-thinkers branding applied. During 2009 and 2010, the Volvos were again repainted, as they had become quite tatty. As part of this, the buses received tougher, non-standard rear bumpers and side skirt panels, to resist dents and scuffs. Skirt marker lights were also fitted. The only bus remaining to be done is 190, which is due to receive a revised livery, the front half of the bus in the standard Southern Vectis livery, the rear half in Greyhound livery and a full rear advertisement of the new "IOW to SW1" travel ticket. 
Now known as 'The Old Girl' having been the oldest working bus in the UK, still operated by the original owner. New in 1939 with ECW bodywork. In 1959 it was converted to open-top and has recently been restored to the original livery of apple and cream. It is now popular for private hire.
Twenty eight Scania OmniCity double deckers are on order for 2008/2009, seventeen are currently in operation with the remainder coming for the start of the 2009 tourist season. The 17 that arrived in 2008 are numbered as 1101 to 1117 and naming the buses after coastal locations on the island has continued. Buses 1101-1117 and 1142-1143 feature a new promotion by Southern Vectis, 'Island thinkers think island buses', with images of island people featuring along the side, with messages on the back of small methods of reducing carbon emissions. Initially the plan was for all the new vehicles to feature this promotion, however the decision was later reversed and now buses 1144-1152 feature adverts. 1150 and 1151 also used to feature full rear adverts for the Isle of Wight College. Also 1102,1105 and 1110 now carry full rear adverts in place of the "Island Message" for The Needles Park.
The buses have Euro IV engines, the current legal requirement. They are the tallest buses in the fleet at 4.34 to offer increased headroom and have been fitted with tree defenders made of tubular steel to protect the front of the upper deck. Each of these buses cost   170,000 new.
Five Scania OmniDekka Double deckers were acquired from Metrobus towards the end of 2009 to cope with service revisions from 20 April 2009 and were fleet numbered 1051-1055. Prior to their arrival on the island, four convertible open-top East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodied Volvo B7TLs were borrowed on loan from Wilts & Dorset that up until then were used on Unilinx services for Bournemouth University. Following the acquisition of the OmniDekkas they are all due to go through an internal refurbishment prior to starting in service. The five OmniDekkas are now in service with 1051-1053 and 1055 receiving full rear adverts.
Southern Vectis' coach fleet is marketed through the use of different trading names, these being companies that Southern Vectis has purchased over the years. None of the coaches are in the two-tone green livery, they are branded as either, Fountain Coaches in bright orange, West Wight Coaches in a raspberry and grey livery and Moss Motor Tours in a blue colour scheme. They are a mixture of different types. They use three chassis types Dennis Javelin, Volvo B10M and DAF SB types, and the bodies are from different coachbilders too, including, Plaxton, Van Hool and Ikarus products.
The Coaches primary role is to transport local students to island schools and the Isle of Wight College. Other than school runs, the coaches are used on a range of contracts and private hire work. At weekends, they can be seen on the mainland used for rail replacement services. Coach numbers 597 and 511 are used for driver training.
Various vehicles are owned by Southern Vectis for purposes such as transporting staff between locations. A number of vehicles are also used for vehicle maintenance to assist broken down buses. Events such as the Isle of Wight Festival and Bestival have in recent years required an events fleet to be created. Many of these vehicles are older buses no longer used by fellow Go South Coast companies. They are brought over in preparation a number of months before the Isle of Wight Festival and remain over the summer to assist with a number of events requiring additional services.
A new system of fleet numbering was introduced to Southern Vectis on 19 September 2006, creating sets of 'hundreds' to identify each vehicle type. The fleet numbers are based around the Go South Coast fleet, so no numbers are duplicated. In 2008, when the new Scania OmniCitys arrived, they had to be numbered '''11xx''' as they would not fit into the '''1xx''' category, Southern Vectis treats "11" and "1" as the same thing.
