In 1967 Parks left Crowd +1 to become the musical director for the Sonny & Cher Show (the beginning of a long career as a session musician).  He was replaced by Lee Pickens (b. December 8, 194?)     guitar.  It was also at this time that Stevie Hill (b. Tulsa, OK)     keyboards/vocals joined the group.  They continued as Crowd + 1 until 1969 when they changed their name to Bloodrock.  They also recorded their first album, the Terry Knight produced, ''Bloodrock'' (ST-435).  The album peaked at 160 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1970.
In 1970 Rutledge moved from behind the drum set to take on lead vocal duties exclusively.  Rick Cobb (b. James Richard Cobb III) took over the percussive duties and added his voice to the group as well.  This lineup recorded their next four albums: ''Bloodrock 2'' (ST-491), ''Bloodrock 3'' (ST-765), ''Bloodrock USA'' (SMAS 645), and ''Bloodrock Live'' (SVBB-11038).
In 1972 Lee Pickens left to form The Lee Pickens Group and Jim Rutlege retired from active music altogether.  Rutlege was replaced by
Warren Ham.  The subsequent album, ''Passages'' was the last time Bloodrock visited the charts. It peaked at #104 on the Billboard 200 in 1972.
The end of the road for Bloodrock came in 1975. Randy Reader left the group and an album, ''Unspoken Words'', remained unreleased until 2000, where it was included as part of the CD release ''Triptych'' (along with ''Passage'' and ''Whirlwind Tongues''). ''Unspoken Words'' featured Bill Ham and Matt Betton.
A reunion concert featuring five of the six original numbers (Jim Rutledge, Lee Pickens, Ed Grundy, Nick Taylor, Stevie Hill, *Chris Taylor) (*in place of original drummer Rick Cobb III) was held on March 12, 2005 in Fort Worth, for the benefit of their keyboardist Stevie Hill.
