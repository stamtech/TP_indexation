The '''Ford D3 platform''' (called '''P2''' by Volvo) is a Ford global full-size car automobile platform.  It was designed by Volvo before the Ford purchase and debuted with the Volvo S80 sedan in early 1999. The platform is designed for either front- or all wheel drive with an extended wheelbase option. 
Ford's D3 platform is slightly different from Volvo's original P2.  For example, D3 features steel suspension arms, rather than aluminum, and other material cost-saving measures. Ford's current D3 vehicles are built at the Chicago Assembly plant in Chicago, Illinois,  while Volvo's are built in Torslanda, Sweden.
