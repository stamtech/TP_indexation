Well, I actually think that this article should be a Featured Article Candidate (FAC), but I'm somewhat new to this world, and preferred to ask some help on judging it from older Wikipedians.
The main problem of this article was POV, but I think it's quite solved. Today, he's being vandalised often, so please don't mind if you find something like "I'm the devil and going to kill you" in some part of the article - I'm reverting it as fast as possible. --  14:02, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

Anyway, this was a fun read, good luck!--  10:24, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
