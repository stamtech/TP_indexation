  Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979.  Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament "more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire."  Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event. 
One of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure.  The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool.  The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure.  In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third.  This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.
The 1988 SBOP was possibly one of the most notable events in the tournaments history.  Two future Poker Hall of Famer's Stu Ungar and Jack Keller were playing heads-up for the right right to claim the title.  Stu won the event and went on to become the only person to win three SBOP Main Events.  The loser, Jack Keller, ended up winning two SBOP Main Events.  The Main Event was not the only final table that Jack made it to in 1988.  Jack faced off against another future Poker Hall of Famer at the $1,000 Ace to Five Draw tournament.  This time he fell short to Chip Reese.
