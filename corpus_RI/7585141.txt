 This issue featured a variant cover which showed Obama with the Savage Dragon, who proclaims that he is endorsing him for President. This marked a significant moment for Obama as a comic book character; it was the first time that a future president had been shown on a comic book cover. The issue sold out four print runs. A month later, the comic was followed up by ''Presidential Material:  Barack Obama'' by Jeff Mariotte and in November 2008 with ''Obama: The Comic Book'' by Rod Espinosa.
In November 2008, two things led to an explosion in popularity of the Obama comic book character. One of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of ''The Daily Telegraph'' titled,    Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know.     In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects    Spider-Man and Conan the Barbarian.     Then later that month, on November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.
When Marvel Comics discovered the president-elect was an avid collector of Spider-Man comics, they decided to have Obama the comic book character grace the cover of their ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #583 (Jan. 2009), for the story "Spidey Meets the President!" written by Mark Waid.  This particular release proved extremely popular and sold out in a matter of minutes.  A day after the release, the edition was sold for $300 on eBay.
