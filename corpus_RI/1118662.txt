Yahoo! Music began as "LAUNCH", a website and magazine produced by LAUNCH Media which Yahoo! acquired for USD$12 million in 2001. LAUNCH was later rebranded as "Yahoo! Music", then simply "Y! Music" in February 2005.  LAUNCH's LAUNCHcast Internet radio and music video offerings were integrated into Yahoo!'s site along with artist profiles containing an extensive selection of music and biographical information. 
Yahoo! Music was the number one online music site in terms of audience reach and total time spent in March 2007.
Yahoo! Music offers a variety of products, including:
In 2001, Yahoo! purchased LAUNCH Media, makers of the LAUNCHcast Internet radio service.
On September 14, 2004, Yahoo! purchased Musicmatch, Inc., makers of the Musicmatch Jukebox software. As of Musicmatch 10.1, Yahoo! has rebranded Musicmatch Jukebox as Yahoo! Music Musicmatch Jukebox, and integrated it with the Yahoo! Music Engine store. The main difference is the branding and physical program.
In 2005, Yahoo! Music became the first major online music service to provide a $5 per month unlimited download service similar to the Open Music Model, albeit with digital rights management, called Yahoo! Music Unlimited.
In 2008, Yahoo! announced that Yahoo! Music Unlimited will be merged into Rhapsody. This merge was completed with the shutdown of Yahoo! Music Unlimited on September 30, 2008.
Yahoo! Music provides officially licensed lyrics.
