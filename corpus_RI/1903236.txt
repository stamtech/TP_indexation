Warren attended Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Virginia, graduating in 1985.  After an outstanding football career in high school, he enrolled at the University of Virginia, but transferred after two years and finished his college career at Ferrum College, a Division III school in rural southwestern Virginia.  He was drafted by the Seahawks in the fourth round (89th overall) of the 1990 NFL Draft.
Initially seeing action as a kick returner, Warren's breakout season came in 1992 when he rushed for 1,017 yards.  He followed that season with three more years with at least 1,000 yards rushing, setting a career-high in 1994 with 1,545 rushing yards.  In 1995, Warren set another career-best with 15 rushing touchdowns.
Warren was a three-time selection for Pro Bowl in three consecutive seasons (1993, 1994, & 1995).  By the end of his stint in Seattle he held the Seahawks' career rushing record, logging 6,706 total rushing yards for the franchise from 1990 to 1997.  In 2005 Shaun Alexander eclipsed that record.
Warren had two sons, Chris Warren Jr. and Conlin Warren. He also has two daughters, Ariana Warren and Kayla Warren.
Warren now helps out coaching for the Edison Eagles high school football team in Alexandria, Virginia.
