He was educated at Huntington School, York.
Rick Witter formed his first band with schoolfriend Paul Banks in 1986, while still in his teens, and played in various local bands, including Brockley Haven, with Banks, Tom Gladwin and John Leach.
In 1990, Witter, along with Gladwin, John   s brother, drummer Alan Leach and guitarist Joe Johnson formed Shed Seven. Rick signed his first record deal with the band in 1993.  Just prior to signing their six-album deal with Polydor Records, Banks joined the line-up as their new lead guitarist, replacing the departing Joe Johnson.  Rick spent the following 10 years recording and touring with the band, co-writing many of the band's songs as they went on to have fourteen consecutive Top 40 hits in the UK. 
Rick also fronts Rick Witter & The Dukes, who feature Rob Wilson on guitar and Stuart Fletcher (ex-Seahorses) on bass.  They independently released their debut album ''The Year of The Rat'' in April 2007.  The LP is dedicated to the memory of Roger Witter, Rick's father.
Witter is also a popular DJ and regularly hosts nights throughout the United Kingdom, playing vintage indie classics.
He is a regular guest at Middlesbrough club night Revival held every Friday at The Medicine Bar.
