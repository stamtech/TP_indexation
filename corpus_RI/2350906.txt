He has qualified for the World Championship three times, his best performance coming in the 2001 tournament, after knocking  Jimmy White out in qualifying and John Parrott in the first round, before being knocked out by fellow Dubliner Ken Doherty. He lost to eventual champion Peter Ebdon in the first round a year later. He has lost in the final qualifying round on seven occasions, a record . 
In 2006/2007 he had something of a return to form, climbing 10 places in the rankings to #34, after five successive falls from his career high of #24, aided by a last 16 run in the Welsh Open. He then reached the last 16 of the Grand Prix early in the 2007/2008 season, and repeated this at the Welsh Open in Newport, by beating Nigel Bond and Graeme Dott, both 5   4, before succumbing to a 5   2 defeat by Stephen Lee. He did enough in the rest of the season to return to the top 32 of the rankings. However, he slipped straight back out the following season after two last sixteen runs were tempered by six first round defeats. In January 2010 he qualified for the Welsh Open, losing to John Higgins in the first round proper.
