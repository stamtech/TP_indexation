While practising in 2003 he pulled off the remarkable feat of compiling three 147 breaks in 4 frames, the only player to do so. He hasn't been able to bring that kind of form to the tournaments, but he has compiled a 147 in tournament play. He is noted for taking a long time to play safety shots.
Notable victories he achieved during the 2007/2008 season included beating Marco Fu 5   3 in last 48 of the Northern Ireland Trophy, and Matthew Stevens 9   7 at the same stage of the 2007 UK Championship from 5   7 behind, to qualify for the final stages of the event played in his home town for the first time. He lost to Peter Ebdon 5   2 and Ding Junhui 9   3 in the last 32 of both tournaments respectively, but his consistent performances have taken him up to number 36 in the 2008/2009 rankings. He also had a notable run in the 2008 Grand Prix, upsetting former World Champion Shaun Murphy 5-3 in the first round (Murphy went on to win the UK Championship and reach the final of the World Championship later in the same season), then coming from 3-0 down against Steve Davis to level at 3-3 and 4-4 and lead by over forty points in the deciding frame, before Davis produced a great clearance to the pink to snatch victory.
