USC head coach Pete Carroll: "Things just happen when he's on the field. He knocks the ball down, knocks the ball loose, forces plays in the backfield and makes plays getting off blocks. You can't hold him down."
Former USC 2-time All-American safety Troy Polamalu: "Playing with him is like having a twin on the other side of the field...He's better than I am, he just hasn't had the platform yet. As soon as he gets it, everybody is going to see because he has everything it takes...If they put him in my position (strong safety), he'd win the Thorpe Award or he might even be the defensive player of the year."
