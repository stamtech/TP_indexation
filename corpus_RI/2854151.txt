Horbury started his career at Chrysler UK and then spent some time at Volvo in the Netherlands, working on the 480 coupe. He has remarked in the past that the Volvo grill under the bumper of the 480 was a last minute addition prior to release, when senior Volvo management realised that the car would not have the classic Volvo grille and slanting highlight. Immediately prior to his longer second 'remarkable'  stint at Volvo, Horbury had worked in the United Kingdom for MGA Developments Ltd. In addition he worked on some key Ford product programs in Europe, such as the Sierra, Escort and Granada.
Horbury is best known for leading the revival of the Volvo brand during his eleven years from 1991 as Design Director. He arrived too late to influence the 1992 Volvo 850 but made an immediate impact with his 1992 Volvo ECC Concept that would influence Volvo design for years to come. He was instrumental in ditching their traditional boxy look in favor of creating and implementing a new design language for the brand. This new look was characterized by distinctive shoulder-lines that ran the length of the car, more curved surfaces, rounded noses, and softer, less utilitarian interiors. He contributed to many designs including the Mitsubishi Carisma related 1995 S40 and V40, the sporty 1997 Volvo C70, which was engineered in collaboration with TWR, closely followed by the 1998 S80. He also contributed to the remaining line up with the 2000 V70 station wagon, the 2001 S60, the 2003 XC90 SUV, and the 2004 S40 and V50. He also oversaw the 1998 facelift of the Volvo 850 series which transformed them into the Volvo S70 and V70 series. Horbury's last Volvo was the 2006 C30. Ex-Mercedes-Benz designer Steve Mattin assumed the responsibility of Design Director of Volvo in 2005. But in the year 2009 he came back by Volvo Cars.
In 2002, Horbury was made head of all of Ford's Premier Automotive Group design studios which included Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Volvo. With talented designers in charge of each of those brands' design, Horbury had little to do and in January 2004 was promoted to Ford of America as Executive Design Director of all Ford's American brands, reporting to Ford   s group vice president of Design, J Mays. Mays explained the decision: 
Horbury runs a staff of 800 including Patrick Schiavone and Moray Callum and has been given the task of renewing the design language of all of Ford America's brands in the wake of sliding sales. So far, he has been responsible for the implementation of Ford's 'Red, White and Bold' design strategy that aims to make American Fords more distinctively American in their aesthetic. This is especially the case with the forthright 'Hi I'm Dave' three bar chrome grilles as illustrated by the 2006 Ford Fusion that will gradually be used on all American Ford models. He also plans to give the Lincoln range a similar frontal treatment as evidenced by the Lincoln MKR concept revealed at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The thinking is to infuse Ford's American brands with a distinctive style in an attempt to make them more appealing to American buyers who are demanding riskier designs that are recognizable from distance.
