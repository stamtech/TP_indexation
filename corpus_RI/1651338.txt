The car was developed in the late 60s based on the successful L-3314 series and went into production in 1974. This version was produced both as a 4x4 and a 6x6. An 8x8 was planned but dropped. Engines were the B30 (B20 in the prototypes) from Volvo's civilian cars. The C3 series feature portal axles with locking differentials resulting in very high ground-clearance (similar to the Unimog) and outstanding performance offroad. The cars are narrow to make it possible to navigate between trees and on narrow forest roads.
They were also sold to civilian customers for rescue services, electricity companies etc. and private use. In the Swedish army the vehicles are designated "Terrangbil xx" (or "Tgb" for short) where "xx" is a number defining the type of vehicle. See table below.
In the 1983 Paris-Dakar rally a Volvo C303 won the class for trucks under 10 tonnes.
Approximately 8000 vehicles of the C3 series were made. Roughly 75% of these went into military service, with the remaining sold to civilian contracts. It was used by Malaysian Army circa 1970-1990, Royal Malaysian Police and civilian use like Telekom Malaysia circa 80s.
