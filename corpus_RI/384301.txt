People in many areas across Canada have expressed wishes that their communities receive heightened autonomy via provincehood or territoryhood. These areas include:
The population of Vancouver Island is 748,937. The population of the Province of Prince Edward Island is 141,000.
Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden and his delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 put pressure on British Prime Minister David Lloyd George to give most of the above territories to Canada as sub-dominions or League of Nations mandates, citing the concessions made to Billy Hughes' Australian delegation with regard to New Guinea and Nauru. Lloyd George eventually declined.
In the 1979 Canadian federal election, the Rhinoceros Party of Canada, a federal political party, included annexation of the United States as part of its platform. It was proposed that the United States become the third territory of Canada. As well, following the 2004 U.S. presidential election, some American voters distributed the Jesusland map, which proposed that the 19 American "blue states" secede from the United States and become Canadian provinces. In both cases, however, Canadian annexation of all or part of the United States was a purely satirical idea rather than a serious proposal.
There have also been some proposals that would result in a change of the boundary status between existing provinces, or even between Canada and the United States.
