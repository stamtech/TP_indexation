Millennium was established in 1999 as a separate high school after serving for several years as "Agua Fria North", a campus for freshmen only.
In the late spring of 2011, covered parking with solar panel installations will be added to Agua Fria and Millennium high schools; the district had already added solar panels to the roofs at Desert Edge High School and Verrado High School in 2010. It is estimated that some 40 percent of the entire district's energy needs will come from solar panels at its high schools upon completion.
In 2009, the 'Marching Tiger Pride' earned the rank of 8th place out of ten bands in the state of Arizona. 
In 2010, the Tiger Marching Band was selected to head to Washington D.C. to compete among 5 other bands, in which they took 1st Runners Up. The Tiger Marching Pride also was selected to go to State Championships, where they placed 9th in the state.
