Schachter released the first version of Delicious (then called del.icio.us) in September 2003. The service coined the term social bookmarking and featured tagging, a system he developed for organizing links suggested to Memepool and publishing some of them on his personal linkblog, Muxway. On March 29, 2005, Schachter announced he would work full-time on Delicious. On December 9, 2005, Yahoo! acquired Delicious for an undisclosed sum. According to ''Business 2.0'', the acquisition was close to $30 million, with Schachter's share being worth approximately $15 million.
Prior to working full-time on Delicious, Schachter was an analyst in Morgan Stanley's Equity Trading Lab. He created GeoURL in 2002 and ran it until 2004.
In June 2008 Schachter announced his decision to leave Yahoo!. ''Techcrunch'' reported that the recent news coming out of Yahoo! about mass resignations of senior staff pressed his decision to leave.
He worked for Google from January 2009 to June 2010.
Schachter is a prolific angel investor, having made over 15 investments in 2009 and 2010.  His investments include high profile companies such as Etsy, Foursquare, Square, Bump and Canvas Networks.
