A feeder bus in Jurong West Extension, Singapore, '''SBS Transit Service 243''' is one of the few bi-directional bus services in Singapore(the others being 410, 231 and 225), plying a 5.1&nbsp;km route that originates from Boon Lay Bus Interchange and runs through 13 bus stops along the way at both directions. 
This service serves as the feeder link from Boon Lay MRT Station, to the various residential estates, schools, shopping centres and the Jurong West Sports and Recreational Complex, along the route as it encircles through the entire town of Jurong West Extension.
Its original route is actually the one currently plied by SBS Transit bus service 242, with the exception of the part where it exited(through Jurong West Central 3 and up to Jalan Boon Lay) and entered(through Jalan Boon Lay, Boon Lay Way and Jurong West Central 2) the interchange.
Together with the original 242 that started in the 1980s, this service started when the initial residential estates were built up in Jurong West Extension, serving the original N7 estate while 242 served the original N9 estate. This service looped by going through street 72, avenue 5 and street 71 before returning to the interchange via avenue 4 and Jalan Boon Lay, just like the current service 242, except for the part where it entered and exited, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
In June 1992, this service was extended to loop at Pioneer Road North via avenue 5, instead of street 71, before turning to avenue 4 and back to the interchange, to serve the then-newly-built original N8 estate, alongside with the portion of N9 estate which was not served by 242. 
In 1999, when parts of the original N6 estates were built up(particularly those along the older section of street 61), this service was amended to serve the area and having it already so close to the interchange, it made no economic sense to create a loop region there as it would be a great waste of resources. Thus, the route extends on to the bus interchange after going through the original N6 estates. From then on, this service became a bi-directional bus service where while the anti-clockwise service(243W) goes through the N6 estate first, the clockwise one(243G) would go through the N8 estate first.
Since the 4th amendment in 1999, this has been the route for bus service 243, though between 18 June 2006 and 26 December 2009, the route was temporarily amended to travel up to the temporary bus interchange at the junction of Jurong West Street 64 and Boon Lay Way, forgoing Jurong West Central 3 altogether when the Boon Lay Bus Interchange was closed for reconstruction as part of the Jurong Point Extension.   
Following the current bus centralisation exercise by the LTA, in future, this service may be amended to pass through the recently-built Pioneer MRT Station, due to the sustainable demand from residents residing near it, at the N6 estates and part of N7 and N8(those near the station and along Pioneer Road North), along the route as currently, there is not yet a service that provides bus connection to the station from the places under the station's serving radius, despite being nearer to it than Boon Lay MRT Station.
