The '''Great Seal of the State of Alabama''' is the state seal of the U.S. state of Alabama.
The first seal was designed in 1817 by William Wyatt Bibb, the governor of the Alabama Territory and the subsequent first governor of the state. When Alabama became a state in 1819, the state legislature adopted the design as the official state seal. The seal prominently features a map showing one of the state's most valuable resources&mdash;its major rivers. The map was shown affixed to a living tree, with no motto.
The design was replaced with a new seal on December 29, 1868. The law describes the design thus:
In 1939, at the request of Governor Frank M. Dixon, the original concept of a map design was returned to use. The new seal was adopted during a special session called by the Governor. The design was described as follows:
The use of stars in the border, the specific design of the letterforms and the map image, the labeling of adjacent states and the Gulf of Mexico, and the application of colors to the seal are not described in the law. 
There is also a seal of the Governor of Alabama. Unlike the State Seal however, it uses the Coat of Arms of Alabama, instead of a map of the State, as it's central motif.
