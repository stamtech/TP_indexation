A major expansion was completed in February 2007 which included The Crystal Room which serves as a combination card room, conference room and poker tournament site. 
Since 1997, Flynt has hosted "the biggest seven-card stud game in the world"; the game started at Flynt's home but moved to his casino when it opened.   As of April 2007, the minimum buy-in is $200,000, with $1000 antes and stakes of $2,000-$4,000. Unlike most high-stakes ring games, Flynt's game is held in a corner of the casino's main poker room floor.  Regulars at the table include Phil Ivey, Barry Greenstein, and Ted Forrest. Another regular was Chip Reese before his death.
