Most of this article is incorrect (it bases its material on Yahoo!'s default settings, which can be changed by league commissioners.)  It reads as a "how to play" rather than an article on the service.  Moreover, we don't have an article on Yahoo! Sports, or on Yahoo! Fantasy Sports, so no reason to merge the little that's correct.     04:26, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
