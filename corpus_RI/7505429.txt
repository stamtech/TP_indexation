Dell was born in the village of Bird Island, Minnesota.  He attended public school in Shakopee, graduating in 1916.  That same year, without any post-secondary education, he enrolled at William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) and obtained his law degree in 1920.  He was admitted to the Minnesota Bar and moved to Fergus Falls.  He practiced there with several different law partners until Governor C. Elmer Anderson appointed him to the Minnesota Supreme Court in January of 1953.  In July of the same year, he was elevated to Chief Justice.  Dell left the court in 1962 due to personal reasons.    
After his retirement, Dell used his personal wealth to embark upon a "one man urban renewal project" of the business area of Fergus Falls.  He died there in 1966.
