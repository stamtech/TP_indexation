Rick began his music career with the Gucci Crew in the early 1980s, mixing music and writing lyrics that would go on to help define the Miami sound. He decided to strike out on his own before the group recorded their second album, and in 1990, he released his first LP with The Dogs - a group he co-founded on Joeyboy Records. This self-titled debut launched the hits "Crack Rock" and "Take It Off," and was followed up in 1991 with the highly successful ''Beware of the Dogs'' album. This LP added hits like "Nasty Dance" and "Get Down" to the group's repertoire, and comparisons to 2 Live Crew were often made of The Dogs among Miami bass / sex rap fans.
Rick soon decided to strike out on a solo career, toying with the notion on his 1991 release, ''The Negro's Back''. While tracks on the LP did feature The Dogs, and its 12" singles did gain club notoriety, it wasn't until 1992 that Disco Rick officially split from the group and signed with Luke Records. There he released the album ''Back from Hell'' as Disco Rick and the Wolf Pack, and scored a hit with the song "Wiggle Wiggle."
1992 proved the end of the line for the recording careers of not only Disco Rick, but The Dogs as well. The latter's final LP, ''K-9 Bass'', was released later that year without Disco Rick, and neither the group nor its onetime leader could gain the momentum apart that they had once had as a cohesive unit.
Rick soon turned his attention to production, going on to assist in the recording careers of artists such as Bone Thugs N Harmony, Ice-T, Fat Joe, and many others. Rick gave Lil Jon of the Eastside Boyz a brand new MPC-3000 beat player in 1996 and showed Lil Jon how to work it before leaving Atlanta to go back home to Miami to work with Bone Thugs. Shortly thereafter, Rick received a call from Lil Jon inviting him to come and work with him on the "Kings Of Crunk" album.
Disco Rick has gained a lot of respect over the years in the South with regional artists like Trick Daddy, Dirt Bag, Pretty Ricky, and more. Local radio stations in Miami keep a close lookout for Rick because he has a knack for bringing local talent to the national spotlight. Disco Rick is also one of the biggest club promoters in Miami, and that gives him access to DJs throughout the city. Rick's studio talents range from writing, producing, recording and mixing, to operations manager for Audio Vision Studios, where he currently spends his time managing and producing for Vision Records, the sister company of AVS.
