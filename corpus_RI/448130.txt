Magnetti Marelli developed electronic throttle modules for Volvo for model years 1999 to 2001. As a result a major recall was instigated by Volvo US to combat the high failure rate of these costly units.  A 10 year/200,000 mile warranty was then offered to affected vehicles mainly as a result of the efforts of American Don Wilson to bring exposure to the Volvo owners' plight.
Magneti Marelli worked with Ford Motor Company and Microsoft Auto to develop an in-dash computer (carputer) for Ford's work truck division introduced in 2008     with a built-in 6.5-inch, high-resolution touch screen and Bluetooth, USB connectivity, GPS Navigation, voice recognition, as well as general office applications, e.g., word processing, contact, and calendar.
