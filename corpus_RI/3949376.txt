CR&nbsp;106 is only one of two routes in Rockland County to keep its numbering from Orange County, with the other being County Route&nbsp;72. CR&nbsp;106 had one spur route, CR&nbsp;106A, which was recently decommissioned.
CR&nbsp;106 runs through Harriman State Park into Stony Point. CR&nbsp;106 begins at the Orange County line in Harriman State Park as a continuation of Orange County Route&nbsp;106, and ends at US&nbsp;9W/US&nbsp;202 in Stony Point. Orange County Route&nbsp;106 has a junction with Seven Lakes Drive just after the Rockland County line. The route proceeds through the state park before ending at NY&nbsp;17 and NY&nbsp;17A. CR&nbsp;106 is only one of two county routes that are shared by Rockland and Orange County. The other is CR&nbsp;72.
Rockland CR&nbsp;106 begins right after Orange CR&nbsp;106's traffic circle with Seven Lakes Drive near Lake Kanawauke. CR&nbsp;106 proceeds east from here providing a border between Harriman State Park (to the west) and Bear Mountain State Park (to the east). It then intersects Lake Welch Parkway, a seasonal road which provides a route to Lake Welch Beach on the northern side of the lake. Then, CR&nbsp;106 splits Lake Welch in two different locations on the southern side of the lake. CR&nbsp;106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point.
Immediately after entering Stony Point, CR&nbsp;106 intersects CR&nbsp;98 where CR&nbsp;106 makes a left turn. CR&nbsp;106 then proceeds east toward its intersection with the Palisades Parkway. This is at Exit&nbsp;15 and is the last residential exit northbound on the PIP, with everything north of this point being exits within Harriman and Bear Mountain. 
Just after its intersection with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR&nbsp;106A & CR&nbsp;69). Also, at this point CR&nbsp;106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR&nbsp;108, CR&nbsp;47, and CR&nbsp;33 as Central Drive. CR&nbsp;106 comes to an end shortly after these intersections at US&nbsp;9W/US&nbsp;202 in downtown Stony Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina.
CR&nbsp;106 originated in 1824, when the road was chartered for the ''New Turnpike'' and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at a fork in the road. At the fork, part of the road became NY&nbsp;210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway&nbsp;416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY&nbsp;17A.
The responsibility for maintaining NY&nbsp;210 was turned over the county in 1982. The road was replaced with CR&nbsp;106.
