Young is from Brooklyn, New York, and attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School. He learned to play basketball at the church where his mother, Edna, worked. Young tried out for the team every year he was in high school, but in all four years he was cut and did not make the final roster. No NCAA Division&nbsp;I schools recruited him, unsurprisingly, and Young ended up at Mitchell College, a junior college located in New London, Connecticut, after graduating high school in 1995. He played college basketball there, and in his sophomore season, Young averaged an NJCAA Tournament record 43.6&nbsp;points per game over five games, including a high of 54. His head coach, Dick Conover, who was in his first season at the helm, was instrumental in guiding Young to play at Niagara University. Young viewed Conover as an uncle, so he took that advice and enrolled at Niagara the following fall.
The final two seasons of Young's NCAA eligibility were spent playing at the Division&nbsp;I institution. A  shooting guard / small forward, he surpassed all expectations, and as a senior in 1998   99, Young led NCAA Division&nbsp;I in scoring at 25.1&nbsp;points per game. It was the highest scoring average for a player at Niagara since Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy averaged approximately 29 in 1969   70. Young scored a career high 44&nbsp;points against Siena, and that season he was named the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year. He finished his two-year Division&nbsp;I career with 1,152&nbsp;points, 306&nbsp;rebounds, 151&nbsp;blocks and 130&nbsp;assists. Young did not get selected in the 1999 NBA Draft, and thus his professional career overseas began.
