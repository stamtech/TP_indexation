Members Mike Farris (vocals), Rick White (guitar), Bob Watkins (guitar), Steve Burgess (bass) and Terry Thomas (drums) released their self-titled debut album in 1994.[]  The album hit #40 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The album was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee and produced by Paul Ebersold.  "The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies" was an album that "played like a gateway between guitar hero classic rock and hippie jam band grooves, often combining both within the confines of a single track."  And their single "Shakin' the Blues" made the album-rock Top Ten.[] 
1996 saw the release of "Magnolia", with varied musical styles ranging from the eponymous title track, a slow-burn build-up rock and roll epic, to "Gypsy Lullaby", a delicate ode featuring Farris' blistering vocals at their best. "Magnolia" was produced by Michael Barbiero and also featured a guest appearance by Warren Haynes of Gov't Mule.
Since the dissolution of the band, Mike Farris has released two solo albums:  2002's "Goodnight Sun", on Mean It! records, and 2007's "Salvation In Lights", on INO Records.
The remaining Wheelies continued performing in various combinations. In 2009, Thundershack studio   s Brodie Hutcheson brought on board vocalist Jarrod England. With the addition of England, the Wheelies found that the chemistry and magic was rekindled, continuing the blazing funky blues rock sound that established their legend. This group will make its debut in Nashville, TN on September the 4th, 2010 at the Mercy Lounge.
