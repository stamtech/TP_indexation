In July, 2003, the Phoenix City Council approved the USD $35 million convention center hotel, to be owned by the city, and developed and operated by Sheraton Hotels as a Starwood facility. On November 3, 2004, the city of Phoenix announced Arquitectonica and RSP Architects had been selected to build the project. Groundbreaking was in late March 2006. The tower was topped out in October 2007. The hotel welcomed it first guests on September 30, 2008.
The hotel has 1,000 rooms, a  fitness center, a  outdoor pool and sundeck,  of flexible, state-of-the-art meeting space including a  ballroom and a  junior ballroom. In addition, there are 16 meeting rooms, two boardrooms, and a terrace for outdoor events. The exterior color palette of browns, oranges and yellows were chosen to represent the desert sky at sunset. The curved roofline mimics the slope of nearby Camelback Mountain.
