Caswell County was formed from a northern portion of Orange County, in 1777.  The newly formed county was named for Richard Caswell, Governor of North Carolina from 1776 to 1780. Leasburg was the first county seat. In 1792, roughly the eastern half of Caswell County became Person County. After the division, the Caswell County center of government was moved to a more central location: the community of the new county seat first was called Caswell Court House. Later, the name was changed to Yanceyville.
Caswell County produced many political leaders, including , Archibald Debow Murphey, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, Bedford Brown, , John Kerr, Jacob Thompson, and others.
