Bill Brotherton with the Boston Herald commented that Adkins "has a heart. Who knew?" and thought that the "heartbreak" songs were the best. Whitney Pastorek with Entertainment Weekly gave the album  a "B" rating, saying that Adkins is one of "Nashville's most likable baritones" and that the album "works best when he puts his heart into it, instead of just his hat". Ken Tucker with ''Country Weekly'' gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it balanced the "rugged" material such as "Whoop a Man's Ass" with love songs as "Still Love You." He also thought that "Don't Mind If I Don't" was "uncharacteristically sunny" and suggested that the song could bring a new aspect to his sound.
Jon Caramanica with the ''New York Times'' compared Adkins negatively to Toby Keith, saying that Adkins "lacks the winking cheekiness and self-deprecation". He thought that "Ala-Freakin-Bama" and "Brown Chicken, Brown Cow" had a similarly "clumsy approach to sexuality" to "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk," and thought that the love songs were "mundane," but called "Hold My Beer" the album's high point. Allison Stewart with ''The Washington Post'' gave the album a negative review, saying that it was less "cartoonish" than his previous work, but said that songs, such as "Hold My Beer," were not meant to be enjoyed by female fans.
