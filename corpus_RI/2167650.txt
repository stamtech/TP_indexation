ATT.NET is a  consumer web portal provided by AT&T, Inc.  ATT.NET has customizable web-based content including news, sports, weather, entertainment, email, applications, products and services.
Email services for att.net customers had been provided by Maillennium, a system developed by AT&T Labs, but are now based on the Yahoo! Mail webmail platform and are branded as "powered by Yahoo!."  It includes the following domains:
AT&T created att.net as a web portal in 1995 in support of AT&T Worldnet service, a dial-up Internet access offering. Following the merger of AT&T and SBC, and the subsequent acquisition of BellSouth, the purpose of the att.net portal widened   it was made to serve as the portal not only for Worldnet customers, but also for customers of BellSouth Dial and BellSouth DSL, as well as for all AT&T ISP customers in the SBC territory who had not elected to use the SBC/Yahoo! portal.  In an effort to make the most of the relationship with Yahoo! and to simplify its offerings, AT&T determined that it would close the legacy, internally-developed portal at att.net.  A plan was developed for all AT&T ISP customers to be provisioned with AT&T-branded accounts on the Yahoo! portal and with Yahoo! premium-level e-mail accounts, and that the web address for this unified portal would be www.att.net. AT&T began migrating customers off the old Worldnet/att.net portal and on to the Powered by Yahoo! portal in December 2008, and the final migrations are scheduled to be completed in May 2010.
On Jan 30, 2008 AT&T announced that it would end a longtime partnership with Google for my.att.net and instead would begin to offer services provided by Yahoo! beginning in the second quarter of 2008 for all AT&T Internet Services customers. AT&T internet customers in the legacy SBC region of AT&T were already on the AT&T Yahoo! service.  On April 2, 2008 , the new att.net powered by Yahoo! was launched.
In 2010, AT&T announced the migration all former Worldnet-based accounts to AT&T Dial, AT&T High Speed Internet Service, or a standalone portal/e-mail service.. Starting April 5, 2010, WorldNet accounts, that were not migrated, began being suspended, a process which was expected to take 10 days. By April 15, 2010, all Worldnet accounts that had not migrated were suspended.
