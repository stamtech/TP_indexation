The Palm '''Treo 700p''' is a cell phone with advanced capabilities, commonly referred to as a  smartphone.  Unlike the slightly earlier Treo 700w, this model is based on Palm OS.  This is the first Palm OS-based Treo model to feature high-speed cellular network support, and is also the first Treo model to support Bluetooth 1.2.
The Treo 700p, while differing greatly in specifications from its predecessors, shares an almost identical form factor with its closest relative, the Palm Treo 650.  The Treo 700p was one of four Treo smartphones released in 2006. 
The Treo 700p is faster than the Treo 650, and like the 650, it is able to play video from downloads using third party software such as TCPMP. The 700p by virtue of its EVDO capability can also play live streaming video including cable TV stations.  This is currently available on Sprint and Verizon Wireless in the United States.  With the release of a Palm OS client for Slingbox, Verizon and Sprint customers will be able to watch live TV on their 700p's via a Slingbox set up in the subscriber's home. With appropriate service, it can also display the latest news and headlines in an on-demand user area.
The Treo 700 is available in the US through Sprint Nextel, Verizon Wireless, and Alltel; in Canada, it is available from Telus Mobility.
However, the phone has been described by some sources as being more    evolutionary than revolutionary        e.g. the phone is a substantial improvement over the Treo 600 and 650 models but it does not offer new capabilities that would make the Treo 700p a quantum improvement over these and other products.  The phone is also certainly not a perfect product, with many reviewers citing the following issues:
As of July 1st, 2008, the phone is no longer listed for sale on the Palm site.
