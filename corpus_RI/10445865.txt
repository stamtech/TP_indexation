Elijah Wood and Ryan Reynolds both appear in the music video for "On the Ground".  Reynolds was the host of ''Saturday Night Live'' on the episode when the video premiered.  They both played themselves in the video.
The video starts with Samberg's character walking down a street as a man (with clothes referring to Red Bull) who is advertising an energy drink approaches him. The man claims that the drink will make him "run faster, jump higher".  Samberg  responds by saying that " I an not gonna let you poison me" and then takes the drink and throws it on the ground.  
The scene changes to another location with a hot dog stand.  The hot dog salesmen tells Samberg that since he comes here all the time, he will give Samberg a free hot dog.  Samberg responds by saying that he is not a "charity case" and "you can't buy me hot dog man" and then takes the hot dog and throws it on the ground.
Samberg is now at the farmer's market with his "so-called" girlfriend and she gives Samberg her cell phone and tells him that it's his dad.  Samberg tells her that he is not stupid and also "that's not my dad, this is a cell phone, Duh!" and he takes it and throws it on the ground.
Samberg then appears at a birthday party and a little boy hands him a piece of cake.  Samberg asks the kid that "what do you want me to do with it? Eat it?!" and then throws the cake on the ground after saying "happy birthday to the ground".
Samberg then comes across actors Ryan Reynolds and Elijah Wood having dinner together.  Samberg calls them "hollywood phonies" and flips their table over.  The actors retaliate by chasing Samberg outside and attacking him repeatedly with a taser. The video concludes with Samberg saying "the moral of the story is, you can't trust the system!"
