Warren started his photographic career at the age of 17 when he was acting in Alan Bennett's play ''Forty Years On'' with John Gielgud in the West End at the Apollo Theatre. Around this time Warren bought his first second-hand camera and started to take photographs of his fellow actors. His first major assignment was when his friend Mickey Deans asked him to cover his wedding to Judy Garland, which marked the beginning of Warren's work as a professional photographer. Upon travelling to New York for personal reasons, he attended an audition for the Broadway production of ''Minnie's Boys''. However, he later declined the role offered to him in favour of returning to London and pursuing photography as his vocation.

In 1999, Warren was inspired to create a clothing line called Swedish Navy Clothing, as a result of his numerous encounters with strangers for his book ''Strangers in the Buff'', including members of the Swedish navy who had posed for Warren in their naval underwear. Their fitted boxers were embroidered with the Royal Swedish Crowns, and Warren decided that this image of the clean cut and healthy young Vikings would be ideal for a range of clothing, including underwear and polo jackets.Strangers in the Buff     Allan Warren
Furthermore, Warren is credited to have invented the ''Hankybreathe'', a handkerchief which allows the user to inhale air through a carbon filter at the mouth, in order to filter out the noxious effects of exhaust emissions. The invention, which is meant to be dabbed in eucalyptus oil, harks back to the nosegay and stems from Warren's experience with asthma in heavily polluted London.
