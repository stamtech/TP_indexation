Non-notable mobile phone. Wikipedia is not a cell phone catalog. Wikpiedia is not a Sony Ericson catalog.
Because few ''substantial'' references are available to support a viable Wikipedia article, we're left with this article, which contains original research, dubious and unclear claims, trivia, how-to information, and so on -- all unreferenced.
Listing at AfD because  was removed with the comment "notable - first ever walkman phone by sony". I don't think being the first prodcut to re-use a brand name is notable. Further, having "Walkman features" isn't described by the article, and is not obvious. I expect it just means that the phone plays music, and it's certainly not the first phone to do that. Even if it was (or really is the first Sony phone to play music), being the first prodcut to do something, particularly in a crowded market where features change so frequently, is a claim to notabilty. Being the ''only'' phone to have a particular feature might be notable, but I don't see that claimed here.   ( ) 23:21, 27 December 2007 (UTC)
