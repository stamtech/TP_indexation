Warren has also been a member of the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints, Florida Tuskers, and River City Gators.
Warren played his freshman season at the University of Oregon in 2001, catching no passes but recording six special teams tackles. He transferred to Utah following the season and sat out in 2002 per NCAA transfer rules.
Warren attended the University of Utah and was a two-year starter under head coach Urban Meyer after playing at Grant Union High School. In his senior year, Warren played a key part in the Utah Utes offense, as they went 12-0 and became the first non-BCS conference team to play in a Bowl Championship Series bowl game. Utah defeated the Big East Conference champion Pittsburgh Panthers 35-7 to become the 2005 Fiesta Bowl champions. Against Pittsburgh, Warren was part of a rare trick play called the hook-and-ladder, or hook and lateral, in which quarterback Alex Smith threw a short pass to wide out Steve Savoy who then lateraled the ball to Warren. Warren proceeded to carry the ball into the endzone from just inside the Panther's 20 yard line. Warren finished the game with a Fiesta Bowl-record 15 receptions and 198 yards.  Warren's 80 catches in a season in 2004-05 remains the Utah single season record. 
Warren was drafted in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After spending the first five weeks of the season on the 53-man roster, he was waived and spent the rest of the 2005 season on the Buccaneers' practice squad. He made the team in 2006, playing in eight games and recording five catches for 63 yards.
Warren broke his leg catching a touchdown with three minutes left in the final game of the 2007 preseason. The injury forced him to spend the 2007 season on injured reserve.
