Andrew   s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business.  Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky.  They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.  Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry with zero losses, proving perhaps once again that banks do not know the taxi business.
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business.  Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.   Andrew Murstein, 29,    by Peter Grant,    40 under 40,    Crain   s New York Business, Jan. 31, 1994/Feb. 6, 1994, p. 11
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business.  He joined Medallion Funding full time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.    
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol TAXI.  The company, which owns and leases several hundred medallions and has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and  New York,  is an established industry leader.  But taxi loans are only a part of the story.  The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores,  manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising.  Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.  About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company   s endeavors.
In 2008 Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance."Medallion Financial Corp."

In November 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and DGB Investments, signed and closed sale on racing aseets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports."Taxi tycoon Andrew Murstein is revved to build race track in New York, bring sport to fans."

Under Murstein   s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1 billion of investments and pays a dividend yield of 8%.  The company has paid out over $150,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public.
