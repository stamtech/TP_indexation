The Timucuan Indians once inhabited the shores of Lake Monroe, where the domain of Chief Utina extended to just north of Lake George.  By 1760, however, war and disease had decimated the tribe, which would be replaced by the Seminole Indians.  Florida was acquired by the United States from Spain in 1821, but the Seminole Wars would delay settlement.  In 1835, the Seminoles burned the port of Palatka on the St. Johns River, then the major artery into Central Florida from the East Coast.  Consequently, an army garrison was established upstream, on the southern side of Lake Monroe near a trading post.  Called Camp Monroe, the log breastwork was attacked on February 8, 1837.  It would be strengthened and renamed Fort Mellon in honor of Captain Charles Mellon, the sole American casualty.  
General Zachary Taylor had a road built connecting a string of defenses from Lake Monroe to Fort Brooke (now Tampa).  The town of Mellonville was founded around Fort Mellon in 1842 by Daniel Stewart.  In 1845, Florida became a U.S. state, and Mellonville became county seat of Orange County, formerly called Mosquito County with its county seat across the lake at Enterprise.  Orange groves were planted, with the first fruit packing plant built in 1869.  In 1870, "General" Henry Shelton Sanford bought  to the west of Mellonville and laid out the community of Sanford.  Believing it would become a transportation hub, he called it "The Gateway City to South Florida."
Several groups of Swedes were imported as indentured servants  to do the back-breaking labor of establishing a new town and clearing the sub-tropical wilderness in advance of creating a citrus empire, arriving by steamboat in 1871.  Incorporated in 1877 with a population of 100, Sanford absorbed Mellonville in 1883.  The South Florida Railroad ran a line from Tampa to Sanford, where the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad ran a line to Jacksonville, and the area became the largest shipper of oranges in the world.  Arriving by steamer in April 1883, President Chester A. Arthur vacationed a week at the Sanford House, a lakeside hotel built in 1875 and expanded in 1882.  
In 1887, the city suffered a devastating fire, followed the next year by a statewide epidemic of yellow fever.  When the Great Freeze of 1894 and 1895 ruined the citrus industry, farmers diversified by growing vegetables as well.  Celery was first planted in 1896, and until 1974 the community would be nicknamed Celery City.  In 1913, Sanford became county seat of Seminole County, created from Orange County.  Agriculture continued to dominate the economy until 1940, when it  proved cheaper to cultivate produce in frost-free South Florida.  
In 1942, Naval Air Station Sanford was established, which conducted operational training in the PV-1 Ventura, PBO Hudson, F4F/FM-1 Wildcat and the F6F Hellcat.  At its peak in 1943-45, NAS Sanford was home to approximately 360 officers, 1500 enlisted men and 150 WAVES and included an auxiliary airfield to the east near Lake Harney known as Outlying Field Osceola. The base was inactivated and reduced to caretaker status in 1946, but was reactivated in 1950 in response to the Korean War and the Cold War. A major construction program ensued, with NAS Sanford redeveloped as a Master Jet Base for carrier-based A-3 Skywarrior and later A-5A and RA-5C Vigilante aircraft.  At its peak in the mid-1960s, the base was home to nearly 4000 military personnel, comprising the air station personnel complement, an Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, the Navy Dispensary, the Marine Barracks, a Replacement Air Group/Fleet Replacement Squadron for the RA-5C, and nine deployable Fleet RA-5C squadrons that routinely deployed aboard large aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean and the Pacific. The latter were heavily enagaged in combat operations during the Vietnam War.  
As a result of the increasing costs of the Vietnam War and concurrent domestic federal social programs, NAS Sanford was one of several stateside military installations identified for closure by the Department of Defense in 1967.  Flight operations were rapidly scaled down during 1968 as the squadrons of Reconnaissance Attack Wing ONE transferred to the former Turner AFB, renamed NAS Albany, Georgia.  This resulted in a significant economic downturn for the City of Sanford and Seminole County with the departure of all military personnel and their families. The airfield was conveyed to the City of Sanford via quitclaim deed by the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1969, renamed Sanford Airport and redeveloped as a general aviation facility. Subsequently renamed Sanford Regional Airport, then Central Florida Regional Airport, the airport commenced commercial airline service in 1995 and was renamed Orlando Sanford International Airport the following year.  The Navy's presence is commemorated on the airport by two historical markers and the '''NAS Sanford Memorial Park''', which was dedicated on Memorial Day in May 2003 and includes a restored RA-5C Vigilante on permanent static display.
The opening of Walt Disney World in October 1971 shifted the economy of Central Florida further toward tourism and residential development, the center of which is Orlando.  But because of Sanford's former preeminence as a trade center, the city retains a significant collection of older commercial and residential architecture, on streets shaded by live oaks hung with Spanish moss.  Its location on Lake Monroe and access to the navigable waterway of the St. Johns River has made it Central Florida's additional center for numerous marinas, allowing access for pleasure boats and commercial vessels to and from the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway via Jacksonville and Mayport to the north.  
Off topic history is that Kenny Chesney's music video for Young was shot on the old bridge over the Saint John's River and on the banks of the river also.
Sanford has been the setting for several recent movies, including ''My Girl'' (1991), ''Passenger 57'' (1992), ''Rosewood'' (1997), ''Wilder Napalm'' (1993), and ''Monster'' (2003).  The Love Your Shorts Film Festival is held in Sanford.

While once a hub for Central Florida transportation with its port on the St. Johns River, Sanford is now home to the Orlando Sanford International Airport (primarily flights to the United Kingdom, other US locations and the Republic of Ireland). Sanford is also home to the southern terminus, Sanford Station of the Auto Train which connects Eastern Seaboard travelers and their vehicles to Lorton, Virginia, which is about  away from Washington, D.C.
Sanford sits near the northern end of the I-4 Corridor between Daytona Beach and Orlando.  The Central Florida GreeneWay (officially Seminole Expressway or simply SR 417 along its Seminole County portion) begins in Sanford at Interstate 4 and forms the Eastern Beltway around Orlando ending at Walt Disney World.  When it opened it was the most expensive toll road in the United States costing $5 one way end-to-end.
Lynx bus service is another transportation option in Sanford, Florida with many bus stops located in a multitude of areas across Metro Orlando.
Future Transportation Projects: The sometimes controversial, but very long awaited Central Florida Commuter Rail System "Sun Rail" is currently scheduled to begin operation in 2012/2013 with a scheduled station to be located in Sanford, Florida.
Below is an excerpt from the Central Florida Commuter Rail project:
Located near the intersection of State Road 46 and Airport Boulevard, vacant property near the Sanford station presents unique development partnership opportunities for surrounding land owners, local residents and community leaders. The SunRail station also will provide direct connections to new residential development on the east side of the tracks. The station also is a short distance from historic downtown Sanford, with its charming mix of antique stores, restaurants, lakefront recreational activities, county services and Central Florida Regional Hospital, as well as to the Seminole Town Mall and surrounding residential development. The SunRail station site includes a park and ride lot with bus drop off area.
