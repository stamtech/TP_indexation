Warren was born on June 20, 1844 in Hinsdale, Berkshire County, Massachusetts and grew up attending common schools and his local Hinsdale Academy.
During the American Civil War, Warren served in the 49th Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry as a noncommissioned officer. At the siege of Port Hudson, Warren received the Medal of Honor for battlefield gallantry at age nineteen. His entire platoon was destroyed by Confederate bombardment and Warren, taking a serious scalp wound, disabled the artillery. Warren later served as a Captain in the Massachusetts Militia.
Following the Civil War, Warren engaged in farming and stock-raising in Massachusetts before moving to Wyoming (then part of the Territory of Dakota) in 1868. Settling in Cheyenne, Warren engaged in real estate, mercantile business, livestock raising and the establishment of Cheyenne's first lighting system, becoming quite wealthy.
Warren's political work included: Member, Wyoming Territorial Senate (1873   1874, 1884   1885), serving as Senate President; Member, Cheyenne City Council (1873   1874); Treasurer of Wyoming (1876, 1879, 1882, 1884); and Mayor of Cheyenne (1885).
In February 1885, Warren was appointed Governor of the Territory of Wyoming by President Chester A. Arthur, although he was removed by Democratic President Grover Cleveland in November 1886. He was reappointed by President Benjamin Harrison in March 1889 and served until 1890, when he was elected first Governor of Wyoming (September   November 1890).
Senator Warren died on November 24, 1929 in Washington, D.C. His funeral service was held in the United States Senate chamber. At the time of his death, Warren had served longer than any other US Senator.
F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming is named after Warren.  Additionally, Warren's daughter married then-Captain John J. Pershing in 1905. Several years later, President Theodore Roosevelt promoted Pershing from captain to Brigadier General over 900 senior officers. Pershing's wife and three daughters were later killed during a fire at the Presidio in San Francisco. Warren was also the first senator to hire a female staffer and, as Appropriations Chairman during World War I, he was instrumental in funding the American efforts.
