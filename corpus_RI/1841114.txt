In the late 18th century, Dutch translators in Nagasaki translated the word ''kaart'' (   map    in Dutch) as ''chizu'' (      , now the generally accepted translation for    map   ) into Japanese. 
From 1800 (''Kansei 12'') through 1821 (''Bunsei 4''), Ino Tadataka led a government-sponsored topographic surveying and map-making project.  This is considered the first modern geographer's survey of Japan; and the map based on this survey became widely known as the ''Ino-zu''. Later, the Meiji government officially began using the Japanese term ''chizu'' in the education system, solidifying the place of the term ''chizu'' for "map" in Japanese.
Generally speaking, traditional Japanese maps were quite diverse in style, depiction, and purpose, and were often oriented towards pragmatic use. It was less common for maps to serve literary or decorative purposes as they might in the West, instead being used for purposes such as the differentiation of rice fields on a feudal manor, or orientation within a temple complex. An example might be an Edo era pilgrimage map depicting the route and location of lodges on the road between Kyoto and Edo, including images of people on the road, with distances between stops differentiated not by relative distance, but by numerical markings, as scale as it is recognized in the West today was not generally used. This compression and expansion of space as necessary to emphasize certain qualities of the depicted area is an important characteristic of traditional Japanese maps, as is the regular inclusion of text, as text and image were not separated in Japan nearly to the same degree as in the West. Perspective on traditional Japanese maps can also be confusing to the modern Western viewer, as maps were often designed to be viewed from multiple points of view simultaneously, since maps were often viewed on the floor while the viewers sat around the map in a circle. Accordingly, many maps do not have a unified orientation scheme (such as North as up), with labels sometimes appearing skewed to each other.
Much of the fundamental concepts of space as depicted in Japanese maps can be traced to Chinese geomancy and Buddhist cosmologies, which came to Japan in the 7th and 8th centuries. Buddhist cosmologies depict the world as it was thought to exist within the appropriate religious framework, often including mythical sites such as the navel of the world and lands beyond the sea inhabited by monsters. In this sense, world maps based on Buddhist cosmology often bear little resemblance to the "real world", though many have at least approximately accurate depictions of Japan, Korea, China, and India. Chinese geomancy brought orientation and a regular grid system, as is evidenced in the street plan of Kyoto, which is based on the plan of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an. North-South orientation, as in China, is thought to have been evident in the plan of the ancient capital (672-686 AD) of Naniwa (modern Osaka) as well. Hence, although many traditional Japanese maps are characterized by the malleability of space and lack of importance of accurate depiction of physical landscape, direction, distance, and relative orientation were quite important.
The oldest known map in Japan is a topographical drawing discovered on a stone wall inside a tomb in the city of Kurayoshi, in Tottori Prefecture, dated to the 6th century AD. Depicting a landscape of houses, bridges, and roads, it is thought to have been made not for practical navigational purposes, but rather as a kind of celestial cartography given to the dead to maintain a connection with the world of the living and allow them to orient themselves when moving on to the other world. Similar maps have been found in other kofun burial tombs as well. There is also evidence that at least rudimentary surveying tools were already in use in this era. One of the oldest written references to maps in a Japanese source is found in the Kojiki, the oldest (albeit largely mythological) history of Japan, in which land records are mentioned. The other major ancient history, the Nihon Shoki of 720 AD, describes a map of the ancient city of Naniwa (modern Osaka). The first map of provincial surveys is thought to be in 738, as described in the ''Shoku Nihongi''. The earliest extant maps in Japan date to the 8th century, and depict the ownership of square rice field plots, oriented to the four cardinal directions. Shinto shrines held maps that they used for agrarian reform, differentiation of property, and land holdings. The system by which these maps were measured was called ''jori'', measured in units called ''tan'' and ''tsubo''.
The Imperial Court of the Emperor Kotoku (            , 597?-654) put the ''Handen sei'' (         , lit. ancient land system) into execution in 646 (''Taika 2'') and asked each province to submit maps of their land holdings, known as ''denzu''. This was considered the first attempt in Japan to draw accurate (as opposed to representational) landscape in picture maps.
During the Shomu reign (            , 701-756), maps known as ''Gyoki-zu'' (         ), named for the high priest Gyoki (      , 668-749), were developed. Gyoki himself served as a civil engineer, although there are no explicitly known direct connections between himself and maps per se. The connection between his name and the term ''Gyoki-zu'' is thought to be derived from his authority as a priest and perceived connections between maps and geomantic rites to drive away evil spirits. The term ''Gyoki-zu'' was widespread and used for maps which illustrated the routes from the Imperial capital to each province in Japan. These maps covered a broader area, and include a much larger portion of what is now known as Japan, giving an idea of the extent of known territory at the time. Maps from these early surveys (conducted in 646, 738, and 796), show the northeasternly extent of Japan to be near the island of Sado, the westernly extent as Kyushu and the southernly extent as the tip of Shikoku, indicating a relative relationship of orientation, but lack of knowledge of the true cardinal directions, as Kyushu stretches much further south than Shikoku, and Sado is closer to north than northeast. More important was relative position, especially in terms of the relationship between the capital in Yamashiro Province (modern Nara Prefecture), and as long as the maps accurately depicted this relationship, they were considered useful. The style and orientation of the ''Gyoki-zu'' is much in line with the general overview of Japanese maps as described above, and it was this style that formed the dominant framework in Japanese cartography until the late medieval and Edo periods.
During the period of ''Handen sei'', major Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and loyal families bought fields and expand their ''shoen'' (      , lit. manors). Following the manner of ''denzu'', they draw maps of their ''shoen''. The oldest known ''shoen'' map is called ''Sanukikoku yamadagun gufuku jiryo denzu'' (                                    ). These ''denzu'' were often drawn on linen cloths. The ''shoen'' system remained in use through the medieval period, and in fact most extant ''shoen'' date back to the Kamakura period (1185   1333). The tradition of ''shoen-ezu'' was carried on to ''mura-ezu'' (         , "picture map of villages"). ''Mura-ezu'' were planar picture maps of individual villages. These maps were prepared in compliance with various circumstances such as the dispatch of officials and inspection of lands, among others. Some ''mura-ezu'' were drawn by professional ''eshi'' (      , roughly "drawing master") or ''ezushi'' (         , roughly "master of picture maps").
During the latter half of the 16th century and beyond, traditional Japanese mapmaking became influenced by Western techniques for the first time with the arrival of Dutch and Portuguese knowledge through the trade port of Nagasaki. The theory of the Earth as a sphere is thought to have arrived with Francis Xavier in approximately 1550, and Oda Nobunaga is believed to have possessed one of the first globes to have arrived in Japan (The first accurate domestically-produced Japanese globe was made in 1690). Japan thus saw full world maps for the first time, changing notions of a Buddhist cosmology matched with physical geography. The first known printed European-style map was made in Nagasaki in 1645, however, the name of the map's creator is unknown. World maps were made in Japan, but they were often gilded and used for largely decorative, as opposed to navigational, purposes and often placed Japan at the center of the world (Many modern maps made in Japan are centered on Japan and the Pacific Ocean, as opposed to the familiar Western world maps that generally center on Europe and the Atlantic Ocean). Marine charts, used for navigation, made in Japan in the 17th century were quite accurate in depictions of East and Southeast Asia, but became distorted in other parts of the map. Development also continued in traditional styles such as the ''Gyoki-zu'', the improved and more accurate versions of which are known as ''Jotoku'' type maps. In these ''Jotoku'' maps, coastline was more defined, and the maps were generally more accurate by modern standards. The name "''Jotoku''" is derived from the name of a temple in Echizen Province (modern Fukui Prefecture), after a map drawn by Kano Eitoku.
The first attempts to create a map encompassing all of Japan were undertaken by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1591, late in the Sengoku period. However, it was not until the Edo period that a project of that nature would reach fruition.
During the Meiji ''Chiso kaisei'' (            , lit. land-tax reform), began in 1874 (''Meiji 7''), villages across Japan developed maps called ''jibiki-ezu'' (            , roughly picture map of lands). ''Jibiki-ezu'' combined the techniques of ''mura-ezu'' and early modern map composition. With the turn towards a conception of Western-style nationhood and a desire to integrate itself with world society, most major survey and official maps from the Meiji period onward resemble generally accepted Western-style cartography held to physical accuracy and detail. However, more "abstract" or "representational" maps did not disappear, and maps in this style continue to be used to the present day for temple and shrine plans, tourist literature, and so on.
