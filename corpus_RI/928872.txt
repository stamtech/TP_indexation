In July 2006, the Orange County Transportation Authority, seeking expanded Orange County service, created weekend service on the IEOC and Orange County Lines.  The IEOC Line schedule currently features 3 Saturday trains and 2 Sunday trains. However, in 2010, the Metrolink board voted to reduce service on the line.
