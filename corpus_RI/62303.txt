Houston County is one of the state's most Democratic counties. Although traditionally Democratic, the county is somewhat conservative on social issues. As such it is part of Tennessee's 8th congressional district, which is represented by Blue Dog Democrat John S. Tanner.
The county is among the most consistently Democratic in the state on presidential elections. Only twice have Democratic candidates failed to carry Houston County at the presidential level. In 1928, Herbert Hoover became the first and only Republican presidential candidate to ever carry Houston County. The second non-Democrat who carried Houston County was George Wallace of the American Independent Party during the 1968 presidential election.
In the 2008 presidential election, when most other traditionally Democratic counties in the state voted for John McCain, Houston County supported Barack Obama. That said the county's vote has been shifting Republican as reflected by Barack Obama's win of barely more than 2%, the lowest margin among all Democratic presidential candidates who have carried Houston County since its inception.
