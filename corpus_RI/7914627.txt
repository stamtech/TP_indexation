The '''Great Rivers Athletic Conference''' (GRAC) is part of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) located primarily in the Southern part of Illinois and has been around since 1982.  The GRAC is located in Region 24 which is about 4/5 the Southern portion of Illinois.  Region 24 right now consists of two conferences and twenty different schools.  The GRAC is one of the two conferences and it consists of nine different schools, with enrollments ranging from low 900   s to low 6000   s.  While each school can field as many teams as they choose, the GRAC and NJCAA only sponsor seven sports teams. At this time the GRAC sponsors: Men   s Golf Men   s and Women   s Basketball, Baseball, Softball, and Women   s Volleyball.  All other sports i.e. Cross Country, Women   s Golf, Wrestling, etc., are self sustained and supported.
The following article will break down each sport.  That is, each sport will have its own section.  Each school has its own sub-section within each section.  At the end of the article, there is a brief description of all other sports, not currently sponsored by the GRAC.
The GRAC currently consists of nine schools, all from Southern Illinois.  The members of the GRAC span the entire width of Southern Illinois with Wabash Valley on the Eastern border of Illinois and Indiana, and Southwestern Illinois on the Western border of Illinois and Missouri.  There are multiple highway rivalries between schools located along Interstate 57 and 64.  A couple rivalries of this kind are John A. Logan vs. Rend Lake and Lakeland vs. Kaskaskia.
Every team in the GRAC fields a men   s baseball team.  The Wabash Valley College Warriors are annually one of the premier teams, not just in the GRAC, but in the NJCAA, given their annual success and multiple conference victories and the amount of players taken in the draft since the year 2000.  This is considered to be an oddity since the school is very small and located in the Midwest and most premier teams are located in the west coast or southern regions.  Other teams that have had many conference titles and players drafted are Southwestern Illinois, John A Logan, Lincoln Trail, and Rend Lake College.
The Volunteers have won nine conference titles, six Region 24 championships, and made two national tournament appearances. Eleven Volunteers have earned NJCAA All   American honors, and fourteen former Volunteers are currently playing professional baseball, with four competing in the major leagues.
