Rehearsals began in Los Angeles in October 1986, with the band by then reduced to just singer Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Guitarist Bjarne Ohlin had already left and drummer JJ Harris was sacked at the insistence of producer Mike Chapman, who regarded him as inadequate for the task. The band's label, Chrysalis Records, told Amphlett and McEntee it regarded the album as a make-or-break record, following the lacklustre sales performance of its predecessor, ''What a Life!''.
Grossman quit at the close of the Australian Made tour and checked in to a rehabilitation clinic for treatment for heroin addiction and Amphlett and McEntee returned to Los Angeles in 1987 to begin recording. The new lineup for the album included Lyon, Machinations drummer Warren McLean and Tootieville bassist Tim Millikan. Recording began at Rumbo Studios, but ceased after complaints about noise by Neil Diamond, who was recording in the next studio. The band transferred to Sunset Sound Recorders with Chapman to complete the album.
The album reached No. 11 in Australia, but despite heavy promotion, was the last to be released through Chrysalis. Amphlett explained: "We still owed them more than a million dollars &ndash; unpaid reimbursement of their advances for recording, distributing and promoting three albums, and supporting all those tours, yet they let us off the hook. Chrysalis knew, as did we, that we'd never be able to repay such a sum. They figured that because ''Temperamental'' hadn't broken us in the States, we were never going to make it there and they'd be smarter to write off our debt as a tax deduction. 'It's time to split', they said. 'We can't do anything more with Divinyls'."
Amphlett believes the album contains some of the band's best songs, written "throughout the emotional maelstrom of the exits of (manager) Vince (Lovegrove), Bjarne, Rick and JJ", including "Back to the Wall", "Punxsie" and "Better Days", as well as "Hey Little Boy".
