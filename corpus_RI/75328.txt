Windermere was established in 1889 and chartered in 1925.
During late 2007, the Town of Windermere filed a proposal to annex Isleworth and Butler Bay, another wealthy subdivision. This was met with extensive debate from town residents and an objection from Orange County, which stood to lose millions of dollars of property tax revenue. After lengthy discussions, and battles with the county, Isleworth remained in the county, but Butler Bay was annexed into Windermere with over 90% of its residents approving annexation via a mail in ballot.

Windermere is located on an isthmus between several lakes in the Lake Butler chain. As such, it is on the shortest road route between the east and west sides of the chain. In fact, the next crossing to the south is 7.5 miles (12&nbsp;km) south at Lake Buena Vista, where County Road 535 (CR 535) and Apopka-Vineland Road meet. The next crossing to the north is at Gotha, the north end of the chain of lakes, 2.25 miles (3.5&nbsp;km) to the north. 2003 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), much of which is commuters passing through, is 17,197 vehicles per day for Sixth Avenue (the east entrance), 18,362 on Main Street north of Sixth Avenue, and 9,484 on Main Street south of Sixth Avenue.
Windermere tries to regulate traffic and encourages traffic to use alternate routes. In 2004, two roundabouts were installed downtown with the largest public works project in the town's history. This has greatly improved traffic flow and relieved cut through traffic. A third roundabout was completed in August 2010 at the intersection of Park Avenue and Maguire Road. This is at the Windermere Elementary School intersection. All roads in the downtown area (laid out in a grid) are dirt roads except for a few through roads:
Until the 1980s, Main Street north of Sixth Avenue and Sixth Avenue east of Main Street were maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) as part of State Road 439 (SR 439). This was given to Orange County as CR 439, and Orange County eventually removed all signs and gave the part inside Windermere to the town. Signs put up by FDOT still mark the north end of CR 439 at SR 50, but no other signs exist, in part because Orange County has a general policy of not signing county roads.
The Florida Midland Railroad, part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, used to run just west of Main Street; there is now a large grassy area between Main Street and the dirt road (often called ''Dirt Main Street'') that ran just west of the railroad. Windermere had a station on the railroad.
Windermere has been the residence of many professional athletes, including Shaquille O'Neal, and most notably, Tiger Woods and his ex-wife Elin Nordegren, after his 2009-2010 scandal. It is also home to former Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles T. Wells and retired General Jay Garner.  Justice Wells was Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court during the Bush v. Gore contested election.  General Garner was the first American leader of Iraq after the Iraq War.
