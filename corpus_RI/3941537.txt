Extending  through Osceola and Orange counties, '''State Road 527''' is a major arterial road through the Orlando MSA. It is partially unsigned from the southern terminus to SR 482. It runs concurrent with Osceola Parkway for just 1 block. It is known as Old Dixie Highway in Osceola County, and Orange Avenue in Orange County, but in Downtown Orlando, at the northbound portion of the one-way pair, is known as Rosalind Avenue. The northern terminus is with an intersection of Fairbanks Avenue in Winter Park The southern terminus is with an intersection of Donegan Avenue near Kissimmee. Along the entire route, the places passed are Meadow Woods, Southchase, Taft, Belle Isle, Pine Castle, Edgewood, Orlando, and Winter Park. In Downtown Orlando, it is one of the 2 state roads that border Lake Eola, the other being SR 526.
This was established to keep this section of former SR 3, which was to be bypassed around 1937 along the Orlando Shortcut (now Orlando Avenue) and Mills Avenue, a state road (and probably part of US 17/US 92). South of SR 22 (Colonial Drive), Orange Avenue was still part of SR 2.
SR 3A was extended in both directions by number in 1939 state law chapter 19049, approved May 12, 1939:
This kept the rest of old SR 3 in Winter Park in the State Road system, as well as old SR 2 south of SR 22 (Colonial Drive), which was bypassed around 1939.
Some state maps show SR 3A on old SR 2 north of Kissimmee in Osceola County and through Maitland into Seminole County, but it doesn't appear that these were added, unless they were added in 1941 when most of the through roads in Orange County were designated as State Roads.
In the 1945 renumbering, most of SR 3A became SR 527; SR 527 extended south into Osceola County but not north to Seminole County. The part between Orlando Avenue and the Park Avenue/Fairbanks Avenue intersection in Winter Park instead became part of SR 426, and was a gap in SR 527.
