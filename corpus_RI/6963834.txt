Most Galanite cars produced were in the four inch range at a scale of 1:42.  Swedish vehicles were common like Volvo, Saab, and Scania trucks, but Volkswagens and other vehicles like the BMC Mini were also made.  Like most rubber vehicles, construction was of only seven parts: a molded vinyl body, two metal axles, and four plastic tires.  These toys were child friendly - soft vinyl, rounded edges and fun colours. 
Other Galanite Toys were of a larger proportion (1:30) and had a less realistic design, with some of the cleaner edges of the true design of a car softened or abstracted for instance.  Models are not numbered on the bottom and usually simply say "Galanite Sweden".
Approximate dates of production for Galanite Toys were the late 1960s through the 1970s. Items produced are similar in concept to what Tomte Laerdal produced in Norway, or what Auburn Rubber Company produced in the United States.
Some examples were exceptionally detailed for vinyl such as the SAAB 96 with a very accurate front end, accurate body proportions and SAAB logo on the trunk lid. The model almost appears to be a company promotional, but none approach the detail of Finnish Stahlberg Models which were purpose built as promotional models for SAAB and Volvo.
