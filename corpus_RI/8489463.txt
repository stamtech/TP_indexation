48 Hudson Avenue was built by Johannes van Ostrande in 1728 just outside the stockade walls and a few hundred yards from the old Fort Orange.  Van Ostrande was a member of the Albany Common Council representing the First Ward, and in the 1750s sold the building to Johannes Radliff, a shoe-maker.&nbsp; During the 19th century the building was the home, and later factory, of Jared Holt. Holt made waxed thread used for sewing leather goods.
48 Hudson Avenue sits within the core area of the proposed Albany Convention Center. The Albany Convention Center Authority has worked with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to preserve the structure, mitigate adverse impacts, and recover archaeological resources. The Authority has also spoken with the owner of 48 Hudson Avenue regarding efforts to preserve the building.
As originally built it was a -story building, with a steep gable roof of fifty-four degrees.&nbsp; The house measured 23 by 33 feet with one large first-floor room and two lofts. The first floor was brick, while the top portion was pine shakes. The building has many rare features not often preserved in other buildings from its time, including a molded anchor beam, the outline of a jambless fireplace, wide pine exterior siding, wide floorboards, steeply pitched roof beams, and original brick walls.
