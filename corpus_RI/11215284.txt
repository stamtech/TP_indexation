Looking for a 1980's mythical/fantasy movie, where there's this witch who's got many replaceable heads, which she keeps each in a transparent glass container.   ( ) 00:20, 14 May 2011 (UTC)
I would really be interested in finding out the name of the young lady they used as the "wife" in their "notbroken" video     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 05:59, 14 May 2011 (UTC) 
I just skimmed the Delgados article, the Scottish indie band.  Didn't they sing "Just Between You and Me"?  I don't see it in their discography.  It seemed like it'd be in the singles section, because it got a lot of radio play, but maybe it's "buried" in one of their albums.  I was curious about the release date.

I was watching a rerun of ''NCIS (TV Series)'' on USA Network. In that particular one, Tony DiNozzo and Ziva David are escorting a star witness from Paris, France, to Washington, D.C., via New World Airlines, a fictional airline. Later in that episode, the star witness is having an allergic reaction to residue from a snack item. Tony and Ziva see what's happening. They immediately contact Donald "Ducky" Mallard from the airplane via their cell phones. From the autopsy room, Ducky gives Tony and Ziva the proper instructions on treating the star witness. Tony and Ziva carefully follow Ducky's instructions. Then the star witness is feeling better. Was that segment inspired by ''Emergency!'' by any chance?  ( ) 21:45, 14 May 2011 (UTC)
I'm not talking about food poisoning. The star witness was allergic to peanuts. (Her pillow and blanket must've been sprinkled with dust from a peanut pack.) While she was having an allergic reaction, Tony and Ziva described the symptoms to Ducky over their cell phones. That prompted Ducky to instruct Tony and Ziva to administer proper pharmaceuticals to the star witness.  ( ) 06:16, 15 May 2011 (UTC)
