Please change my current username   to  . Even though I never intended to offend anyone with my original username, people have nonetheless taken offense to it anyway. To make sure I don't unintentionally hurt anyone else I've decided the best thing to do would be to have it changed. Thank you. --  18:51, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

Please change   to  .  I registered   and started over, but then found that you can arrange to have your account name changed.  You can check that both accounts were created by me:  - I redirected to the new account and  - I mention my old account there.  Sorry for the confusion. --  15:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

Starting to get a little heat from vandal types tracing my identity - I presume a change from   to the highly anonymous   will not compromise my sysop status/tools?     19:10, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
Sorry to bother you with this so soon after a typo revision to user name, but I'd like to withdraw and get some distance. To facilitate that process, please change my user name to SnarkBoojum. Thanks in advance.   20:14, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

Please change   to  .  I am requesting this so as to adopt the callsign of my US Amateur Radio license.  If possible, I would like my few edits to migrate to the new account.  If there is a more appropriate method of doing this, then just let me know.  Thank you very much.   13:47, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
Please change   to  .  I am requesting this so as to adopt the signature I am now currently using on the talk pages.  When I first came into the comunity over a year ago, I created the account using the logo I use for my emails.  With the release of Revenge of the Sith, I began using my Star Wars role playing game name to sign talk pages.  I would like to make it official, If possible, I would like my edits to migrate to the new account.  Thank you very much.

Please change my username from   to   and transfer all contibutions to my new ID. Basically, I'd like to insert a period "." between my first and last names and capitalize the first letter of my last name. Thank you.
Done. It is, most often, easier to rename a user than to encourage them to get a new account; it tends to encourage the registration of, and temptation to use, multiple accounts. While the use of multiple accounts isn't prohibited in most cases, it is discouraged, and it's best we don't foster it in this manner.   (       ) 20:05, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

Reason = I used to be in a band called "Blue Rhythm Johnny". I am no longer with that band, and they'd rather I drop this from all my sn's. Time for a fresh start anyway, right?

Please change   to   and transfer all contibutions to my new ID. I would prefer something a little more private and my current username is too close to that used for other purposes by someone I know very well. Thank you.   04:12, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
Please change "Adambrink" to "Adam Brink" (not currently in use). I usually use adambrink, all lower case, and was not aware that you would capitalise the first letter.  If it must start with a capital I would rather have my surname capitalised and spaced out too.  I know the change may seem anal.  But I wouldn't be editing if I wasn't anal, now would I. --  06:14, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
Please change Davestraub@yahoo.com to "David Straub." I live in China and I'm using a webproxy to accesss wikipedia. For some reason, the @ in my user names causes me not to be able to access "my contributions" and "my talk" pages. I just get a page that says "Bad Title." It's the same problem with any webproxy I use. It's really annoying. Changing the user name should work. 
Just of note, any wikipedia entry that has an apostrophe in it's title is also inaccessible through the webproxies. I've tried a number of webproxies and I keep having the same problem.
Please change   to  . I left all projects. Thank you.   13:01, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
