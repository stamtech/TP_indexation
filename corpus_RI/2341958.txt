The property, which constitutes several city blocks, is chiefly credited for West Palm's urban renaissance. The area where CityPlace stands was formerly a poverty-stricken and high crime area.
Macy's, Muvico Parisian 20 and IMAX, and Publix are the center's anchors. Apart from shopping, dining, and cinema, the center is now at the forefront of West Palm Beach's entertainment complementing establishments located on nearby Clematis Street.
The Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts and Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr. School of the Arts are located within walking distance to CityPlace, as is the Palm Beach County Convention Center. An early-century trolleybus circles downtown between CityPlace and Clematis.
The shopping center is the epitome of a New Urbanist mixed-use development. Most of its architecture is West European-inspired, with mainly Mediterranean and Venetian elements. However the ''CityPlace Tower'' constructed in 2007, and associated with the original property, is postmodern. This tower has been downtown West Palm Beach's first office development in over twenty years. Later phases of CityPlace, including ''Montecito Palm Beach'' (formerly called ''The Mark at CityPlace'') and ''CityPlace South Tower'', retain loyalty to the original development's architecture. Excluding these more recent additions, CityPlace proper contains 570 private residences.
The ''Harriet Himmel Theater'', a former Methodist church, is located at the center of CityPlace. Built in 1926 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, it has undergone a six million dollar restoration, and serves today as a cultural center. Surrounding squares, arcades, and promenades feature 3.5 million dollars of  water fountains and lush landscaping.
