Hello! Can you make a map for Tennessee State Route 19? There is no hurry, the article has been flagged by the map police as not having one but being in need of one. ;-) Thank you very much!
Sorry, I did not list it at the end of the page but here, at the end of the Tennessee map requests,  so it is sorted better. 
It would be great to have a map for Tennessee State Route 180. It is not a long or important road, as a matter of fact it is a secondary highway, and the request is not urgent. It would be nice to have a shield for 180 on the map, the county line (Haywood and Lauderdale) and the towns Nutbush and Gates. Whatever works best and is reasonable in your opinion. Thank you very much!  &nbsp;\&nbsp;  01:19, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
Perfect, Thank you!  &nbsp;\&nbsp;  06:24, 26 January 2008 (UTC)
I need maps for the following articles:
I know its a lot, but if anyone's up to it.     11:35, 26 January 2008 (UTC)

My name is Johnny Russell and I am working on the article for Washington State Route 509 in the south of Seattle. If possible, I would like a map showing the proposed expansion of SR-509. The URL of the page is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Route_509 and a Washington State Department of Transportation map of the proposed construction can be found here. Thank you a lot if anyone chooses to make this map.
I'm working on bringing this article up to at least B-Class as well.  Its a short secondary route so this should be a low-priority request....Thanks everybody   ( ) 05:43, 15 December 2007 (UTC)
Discussion board mentions need for a map on this page.  I have done the majority of the work on the article, so I'd like to request a map for it.  Thank you!   ( ) 20:31, 3 January 2008 (UTC)
Another TN article has been created and needs a map, most of this route is overlapped with US 412.  Thanks   ( ) 06:55, 7 January 2008 (UTC)
The map that's up there now is "good enough" (prompted by a FAC request) but the line widths are different because it's about as hacked together as one can get. If someone can put up a cleaner version, that'd be appreciated. Thanks. &mdash;  ( ) 23:04, 18 December 2007 (UTC)
Please place a map for LaVista Road, a major highway that runs through Atlanta, Georgia. Also, place shields for I-285 and the other state and U.S. highways that intersect with this road. Thanks. -- 
It could use a map badly, its an old article of mine, and its the missing link I need.    20:54, 1 February 2008 (UTC)     20:54, 1 February 2008 (UTC)
Article under WP:Illinois Routes, 2.2 miles in Chicago. It's the only road where you can get an address on 100 north, 100 south, 100 west AND 100 east! &mdash;  ( ) 15:08, 3 November 2007 (UTC)
Could you please provide a map for South Parkway located on Grand Island, New York.
People have reviewed the article and say that it needs a map and to come here to have one done.
The page to place it on is: South Parkway/Beaver Island Parkway

Here's the list of what I need:
If you can make these overtime, it'll help, thanks!!!
Just one more, please? It should be the last. Thank you very much for the other ones!
A few improvements have been made to Tennessee SR 79, is it possible to get a map of this short secondary route.  Thanks All   ( ) 03:00, 5 February 2008 (UTC)
Requesting a map for Farm to Market Road 1 in East Texas with shields of other major routes included.  Thanks! -- '''   ''' 19:42, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

The '''Aurora Expressway''' is a major highway linking Buffalo with its suburbs of West Seneca, Elma, East Aurora, and other southeast regions. There is currently no map on the NY 400 page. Would it be possible for you to make up a map of NY 400? 
If you could make a map, can you include on the map the signs of the routes NY 400 passes over or interchanges with? (I-90, NY 240, NY 277, US 20/NY 78, US 20A/NY 78, and NY 16, Especially NY 16 that NY 400 overlaps and paralells). Additionally, include the town names.
NY 324 is a major thoughofare in the towns of Grand Island, Tonawanda, Amherst, and Clarence.
Could you please make a map of NY 324's route? If you can include the names of the road: (Grand Island Blvd. on Grand Island & Tonawanda, and Sheridan Dr. in Tonawanda, Amherst, & Clarence).
Please include all important cross streets and route shields, town names, as well as the 
If you could create a map like the one on the NY 104 page,that would be great!

There is an error in the current map,  .  It shows US 283, which should actually be US 287.  --'''   ''' 15:19, 12 February 2008 (UTC)
If anyone can make maps for these, or explain to me how to use Quantum GIS. I downloaded it but as of now it is all Greek to me. Thanks! -  ( ) 05:28, 11 February 2008 (UTC)
Anyone? I make an edit without the proper Wiki standard sources I get a response in 30 seconds. No one has the time to write me up a quite tutoral for Quantum GIS?!?!? It would be great appreciated! -  ( ) 17:22, 17 February 2008 (UTC)
Thank you! And didn't mean to come off that way. It had just been sitting here for awhile and I figured someone must know how to use Quantum. -  ( ) 05:15, 18 February 2008 (UTC)
I like both the simplicity and theory of this image, but I don't like the fact it looks like someone scanned it in from an old textbook. We can make a SVG replacement for this image, with shields and to MTF standards, but also keep the generality of it (including "City (A), City (B), City (C)".) &mdash;  ( ) 17:10, 13 February 2008 (UTC)
If someone wouldn't mind making a map for this route. I live in the area, and the page looks great! Thank you! -  ( ) 17:51, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
Article is finally the right length for a map. Finding info on Irving Park Road prior to 2001? Nearly impossible. :-D &mdash;  ( ) 18:53, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
I am preparing this article for A class review. I'm surprised it passed GA without a map. Thanks in advance   ( ) 07:31, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
I made a crude SVG map for this article a while ago, but it'd be better if the article had a new map with a wider scope. --    -   07:36, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
If someone can make a map of that route in Orange County whenever they have some spare time, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! -  ( ) 18:58, 21 February 2008 (UTC)
I need maps for the following routes:
As soon as these can be done, thanks!     01:28, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
I've tried improving a bit on Tennessee SR 18, I think it could use a map to boost its rating.  It runs from MS 7 at the state line north to Jackson in West Tennessee.  Thanks again.    ( ) 03:48, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
If someone could make a map of this parkway in NY/NJ in your spare time that would be awesome. Thanks again! -  ( ) 05:44, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
Thanks stratosphere! -  ( ) 23:41, 22 February 2008 (UTC)
Just trying to get Phoenix's huge freeway system some popularity. Thanks to all who help!
The following articles are all B-class and do not have a map.
SVG format and shields of major routes is preferred, thanks.  --'''   ''' 19:53, 20 February 2008 (UTC)
If maps can be made for those two routes when anyone has some free time that would be great. Thanks in advance! -  ( )
Both of those appear ready for maps too. Thanks! -  ( ) 04:31, 25 February 2008 (UTC)
Here ya go!  |  21:43, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
Thanks Strato, I'll be back! Muhahahahahaha! -  ( ) 22:56, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
Would like to have a map of Texas with just the Interstates with their shields.  SVG preferred, thanks.  --'''   ''' 18:00, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

If I could get a map for New York State Route 292, that'd be great. Thanks,     23:37, 26 February 2008 (UTC)
Very short spur to O'Hare International Airport &mdash;  ( ) 18:57, 27 February 2008 (UTC)
New York State Route 32, New York State Route 376, and New York State Route 12 - the first two are GACs and the last is a 220-mile route whose article is undergoing a revamp. A map would look great in all three places. TIA,     -   08:26, 28 February 2008 (UTC)
Also New York State Route 9A - it's a GA without a map. So sad... :P --    -   01:48, 29 February 2008 (UTC)
Recently promoted to GA. Currently has a crappy map and a standard one would be much better. If possible, please include town lines on the map. Thanks. --  |   14:20, 28 February 2008 (UTC) --  |   14:20, 28 February 2008 (UTC)
