Lawrence University has hosted a Rotary Phone Throw in 2005, 2006, and 2007.  This competition has similar rules to the mobile phone throw, yet uses rotary phones.
The '''Mobile Phone Throwing World Championships''' have been held annually since 2000 in Savonlinna, Finland.  The first national competition was held in Trondheim, Norway in June 2004, with several other countries across Europe also staging their own events.  The first winter championships were held in Stoos, Switzerland in February 2005.  Commonly, the prize for first place in a national event is entry to the world championships, and the grand prize for winning the world championship is a new mobile phone.  Many events are supported by mobile phone recycling organisations and promote the recycling of the phones.
In the UK the championships are held every August and organised by 8th Day UK Ltd. The first event in 2005 was held at Richmond Golf Driving Range, the 2006 event at Tooting Bec Athletics Track in London. ActionAid Recycling partnered the event to raise awareness for mobile phone recycling and raised money from donated phones for the first two years, but due to the involvement of a casino (Golden Palace) in the 2007 event and the associations this would have in relation to charity, are no longer involved.http://www.8thdayuk.com".

Freestyle phone throwing is an event held in which contestants enter a mat that is around 1" thick to soften impact in the case that a phone is dropped. Players begin perfrorming a series of tricks that include various flips, spins, high throws, etc. If you drop your mobile phone you are automatically out and judges take your score from that point. 1 minute is given for a total "run time" and after the minute is up, if you have not dropped your phone, you get a score from 1 to 100. Phone classes include standard phones, which are free to $50 phones with either no moving device such as slide or flip open, or with the standard flip open style. Second class is the "Advanced" class, which includes phones with full keyboards, slide movement devices, side-kick flip devices, or touch screens. This class is based on the fact that if the phone is dropped there is more of a consequence since the phones are so elaborate and/or expensive.
