The '''Volvo 700 series''' was a range of mid-size car manufactured by Volvo Cars in the 1980s and 1990s.  The 700 series was introduced in 1982, followed in 1990 by the 900 series. The 700, designed by Jan Wilsgaard, was originally to have been a replacement for the 200 series, but production of that model continued.
The most visible differences between the 700 and the 900 series were the more rounded corners on the body of the latter, and a somewhat better-appointed interior. The 960 was substantially revised for the 1995 model year, improving the handling. The range was first augmented and finally supplanted by the Volvo 850 in 1993, with the last of the 900s being sold in 1998. Some 900 series were built as chassis for ambulances and hearses after the main production run had been completed.
This series, ending with the 940, S90 and V90 were the last of the rear wheel drive cars from Volvo.
The 760 was Volvo's attempt to cement a place in the prestige market, after building a reputation for being solid and safe rather than out-and-out luxurious cars. Jan Wilsgaard, head of Volvo's Design and Styling team, proposed over 50 new designs for the new car. It was introduced to the US in 1982 for the 1983 model year as the 760 GLE sedan. This new design was criticized by the media when released: Gordon Murray of Autocar Magazine said, "To me it's obscene! That goes right against the grain of what everybody else is trying to do. To me it looks like a European version of a North American car. It produces the same amount of power as a 2600 or 3500 &mdash; in this day and age it disgusts me to see something about like that. It's a definite step backwards." All that changed however when Autocar and Car & Driver got their hands on a turbo intercooled 760; they said it was one of the best handling and fastest accelerating cars they had seen in a while, thundering from 0-60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in under 8 seconds.
Turbocharged and intercooled variants were added in 1984, station wagon variants and the 740 &ndash; the 760's lower-specification sibling &ndash; were introduced for the 1985 model year. In 1985 Electronic Traction Control system was introduced.
For the 1988 model year, the 760 received numerous updates. From the outside, the most noticeable of the over 2,000 changes were the revised front sheetmetal, including an aluminium hood, recessed windscreen wipers, and new aerodynamic headlights. Inside, all 760s were equipped with a new electronic climate control (ECC), a revised dashboard, three-position tilt steering, and a new stereo system. Underneath, sedans received the same multi-link independent rear suspension that was used on the 780. Along with the revised dash, the interior saw the addition of a revised dome light and many fabric accent pieces.
The Volvo 760 was also used as a police car in several countries. East German leader Erich Honecker also often used this Volvo in his governmental car pool.
For its final year of production, 1990, 760 sedans received tail lights in the style of the Volvo 780 (see below), and minor interior changes. The 760 was discontinued after the 1990 model year (with production ending on 27 June 1990), and was replaced by the Volvo 960, an evolutionary update of the 760 chassis.  The Volvo 740 outlived the 760, remaining for another two years.
All 760s were built in Kalmar, Sweden, Canada, or Ghent, Belgium.
Production of the 740 ceased in late 1992, though the engine, transmission, chassis, and other details continued in the Volvo 940 (see below), which was essentially identical to the 740 with the exception of the rear of the sedans.
In 1990 the 740 received a minor facelift with new composite headlamps and 780-style tail lights. In 1991, both the 740 and the newly introduced 940 received an updated dashboard, similar in appearance to the ones found in the 760. The 740 remained mostly unchanged for the 1992 model year, and was phased out in 1993 in favour of the Volvo 940.
Aside from styling, 1990 marked a number of mechanical improvements to the 740 series.  The B200 and B230 motors received larger  connecting rods.  The 740 Turbo switched from the Garrett T3-series turbocharger to the Mitsubishi TD04 series, offering quicker spool-up and better low-RPM boost at the expense of top-end performance.  The electronic fuel injection system was upgraded from Bosch LH-Jetronic 2.2 to 2.4 (in 1988 for naturally aspirated cars, 1990 for Turbo cars).  The newer fuel system offered onboard diagnostics, which are accessible from the engine compartment, and require no special equipment.  In 1993, the final year for the 740, the mechanical engine cooling fan was replaced with an electric fan. The 1990-93 Volvo 700-series cars may very well represent one of the most reliable 4-door passenger sedans of its era due to a limited number of engineering limitations and solid build quality.
Trim levels were 740, 740 GL, 740 GLE, 740 SE, 740 GLT and 740 Turbo worldwide; Continental markets had some exceptions to this rule. The 740 Turbo 16v (all other markets had the 2.3 L 8v engine) sold only in Italy used the 2.0 L B204FT engine found also in the 780 on the same market and it was equipped with the ECC from the 780 as standard.
The Volvo 780 Coupe debuted at the International Auto Show in Geneva, Switzerland in 1985, marking Volvo's return to the two-door coupe market following the departure of the 262C in 1981. The 780 became available in Europe in 1986 and in United States a year later.
Like its predecessor, the 780 was designed and built by Carrozzeria Bertone in Turin, Italy. The hood, trunk, and roof lines were all slightly lower than the standard 700 series profile, and the C-pillar was wider and had a more gradual slope down to the trunk. Headroom was improved over the 262C because of Bertone   s mere 1&nbsp;cm lowering of the roofline. Window frames all had black matte trim, and were accented with chrome. Chrome also highlighted the door handles, bumpers, and side mouldings. Originally, it had been planned to use a smaller 2,458&nbsp;cc  turbocharged version of the PRV V6 (as seen in the Renault 25 and Alpine), which had been successfully tested in 740s and 760s. In the smaller engine room of the 780, however, the engine overheated and the PRV V6 Turbo never appeared in a Volvo.
In the first two years the 780 was available worldwide ('86 and '87) the 780 was available with the B280F V6 engine and a solid (live) rear axle. In the Italian market, originally only the Volkswagen built TD24 was to be offered, with , but soon the V6 also became available and a  2.0-litre turbo (B200ET) Italian tax special was also added in 1986. In the following year, the 780 came equipped with Volvo's independent rear suspension, which used self-leveling Nivomat shocks, to keep ride height correct.
The B280F at this point had roughly , but the car itself was nearly . To address concerns over performance, Volvo introduced the B230FT+; a B230FT with Volvo's boost controller, Turbo+, increasing the engine output to . The following model year saw it increase to . In Italy, late 780s were available with the B204GT. This was a 16 Valve Turbo motor producing . In the car's final year, 1991, it was rebadged simply as "Coupe".  At this point, the car came only in turbo guise.
Volvo's official production total for the 780 is 8,518 cars built between 1986 and 1991. As before, a coupe would remain absent from Volvo's model line for several years, until the front-wheel drive C70 premiered in 1995 for the following model year.
Beginning in 1985, the 740 and 760 models were available in both saloon and estate forms.
North American model availability:
These engines were offered on 700 and 900 series vehicles:
Volvo offered various transmissions depending on the year/model/engine combinations including the:
There were also different suspension combinations depending on the model chosen:
Later in 1991, Volvo offered a sedan and wagon badged the 740 SE, standing for Special Equipment. The 740 SE only came in three colors, red, black, and white and had a special factory color-keyed body kit including front and rear bumpers, side skirts, and a spoiler on the sedan. The 740 SEs, along with the 740 Turbo sedan, were subsequently discontinued for 1992. Mechanically the 740 SE was the same as a normal 740 Turbo but with many options such as a power sunroof and leather seats as standard equipment.
The SE badge was one of the more confusing badges. In the US, the 940 SE was in fact a 960 Turbo with the four-cylinder B230FT engine, the 940 SE badge presumably chosen by Volvo in order to maintain the link between name and number of cylinders. In Sweden, the 940 SE was an ordinary non-turbo 940 with some optional extras as standard, most notably painted mirrors and bumpers. In the UK, the 940 SE was a 2-litre Turbo with some extras as standard aimed specifically at the company car market as 2-litre engines receive a tax benefit.
