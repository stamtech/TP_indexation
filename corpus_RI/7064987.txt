The ''Big Books'' were published between 1994 and 2000. Just over half of them (ten out of seventeen) were written by a single author (including Doug Moench and John Wagner), with Jonathan Vankin taking over the writing of the later volumes.
A wide range of artists worked on the stories. Notably it was the first American work for Frank Quitely. Rick Geary reckons he is the only artist to contribute to all seventeen volumes.  E.C. alums Joe Orlando, George Evans and Marie Severin are present as are Russ Heath and Gray Morrow. The Big Books were the last stands of masters of horror Tom Sutton and Pat Boyette. Other artists who were regular contributors to the series as a whole include Bob Fingerman, Eric Shanower, Lennie Mace, Randy DuBurke, James Romberger, Salgood Sam, Steve Leialoha, Joe Sacco and Roger Langridge.
Slated for a 2001 release, Paradox had planned to publish the 18th book in the series, ''The Big Book of Wild Women''. The book is narrated by "Susie the Floozie," and was to profile notable women throughout history who had made an impact on our culture while pushing the envelope of unconventional behavior. Among the women to be profiled were risque nightclub singer-comic Rusty Warren, B-movie goddess Tura Satana, presidential candidate Victoria Woodhull, 19th century sex star Lola Montes, legendary seductress Cleopatra, scandalous writer Anais Nin, and kinky pin-up icon Bettie Page. According to DC, however, the book is in a perpetual "pre-production"&nbsp;    even though much of the work on the book was completed by the contributing artists.
