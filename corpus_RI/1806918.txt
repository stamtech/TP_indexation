The OCFEC is managed by the '''32nd District Agricultural Association''', a state special-purpose district in the Division of Fairs and Expositions of the California Department of Food and Agriculture formed in 1949. Its board is appointed by the Governor of California.
The Orange County Community Fair Corporation sponsored the first county fair in 1890 in Santa Ana, the county seat. In 1894, it was taken over by another group, the Orange County Fair Association. In 1916, it was passed again to the Orange County Farm Bureau, before passing to an Orange County Fair Board in 1925, when it was relocated to Anaheim.
After World War II, the state formed the current association and purchased land then occupied by the Santa Ana Army Air Base for use as the fairgrounds, which became part of the City of Costa Mesa at the latter's incorporation in 1953. 
On March 18, 2009, this venue was also the host of a town hall meeting held by President Barack Obama on his visit to Southern California. He used this opportunity to address the economic crisis and to take questions from the audience.
The OCFEC provides educational, entertainment and recreational opportunities for the general public and preserves the heritage of California agriculture. This is achieved by showcasing the talents, interests and accomplishments of the citizens of California, especially Orange County residents. Our mission is served through the annual OC Fair, The Ranch, Youth Expo and more than 100 events throughout the year.
