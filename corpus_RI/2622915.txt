Metropolitan Bus Service Contract (MBSC) Region 14
The Forest Coach Lines fleet mostly consists of Volvo and Mercedes-Benz buses.
They have a green and white livery and are mostly manufactured by Custom Coaches and Volgren.
Three buses are in special livery - two for route 197 (Macquarie University to Mona Vale) and one commemorating Forest Coach Lines' 80th Anniversary.
Their Volvo fleet primarily consists of B10M and B12B buses and they used to have a sponsored lease from Volvo of their Low-Emissions Bus.
Their Mercedes-Benz fleet primarily consists of O405 and O500 buses.
They have sixteen articulated buses, two touring coaches, one Fuso minibus, a small Bustech MDi shuttle bus operating around the Killarney Heights area and 73 general buses.
Forest Coach Lines participate in the MyZone ticketing system, though the buses do not have magnetic stripe readers and the drivers mark MyBus TravelTen tickets by hand.
All buses are equipped with AES Prodata Datafare 2000 ticketing platforms which support a smartcard-based multi-ride ticketing system called ''Datafare''.  Service transfers are supported within the Forest Coach Lines network.
