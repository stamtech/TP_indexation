Telecom launched internet service provider Xtra in 1996, which is New Zealand's largest ISP (). In 2001 Telecom partnered with MSN to create the web portal XtraMSN, which by 2006 was receiving over 100 million total page impressions in a single month.  Visitor numbers to XtraMSN grew by 45 percent in its last two years and the website attracted more than 3 million unique browsers per month.
In December 2006, Telecom had made a new agreement, founding a joint venture with Australia's Yahoo!7 - itself a joint company between the Seven Network and Yahoo! Inc. - to form Yahoo!Xtra. The six-year-old Telecom and Microsoft portal ended on 1 March 2007, with the users invited to go to either YahooXtra.co.nz or Msn.co.nz.  
Telecom reportedly leaves the content management of the portal to Yahoo!, who operate an Auckland-based office consisting of Sales, Marketing, Ad Operations, Production and Finance Departments. The Editorial team manages local news, sport and entertainment content..
The Yahoo!Xtra's board of directors is chaired by the Yahoo!7 CEO, Rohan Lund, and consists of the following members:
In April 2007, Kevin Bowler was appointed as the Auckland-based CEO of Yahoo!Xtra, but departed the business in early 2010.
Yahoo!Xtra's 'X meets Y' promotion at launch featured a television commercial with Regina Spektor's song ''Fidelity'' playing whilst a young couple undertake in a lingering kiss. This helped throw the anti-folk star under the spotlight in the New Zealand music scene, ''Fidelity'' becoming a hit single and one of Spektor's most successful tracks.
