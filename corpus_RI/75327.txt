Williamsburg is a large subdivision bounded roughly on the north by the Beachline Expressway, on the south by the Central Florida GreeneWay, on the east by Shingle Creek and on the west by International Drive.  The main intersection of the community is at Orangewood Blvd. and Central Florida Parkway.
In the early 2000s, Williamsburg's Homeowners Association worked with the Orange County Board of County Commissioners to make sure that traffic from the Orange County Convention Center did not pass through the interchange between Orangewood Blvd. and the Beachline, which would expand to connect to a southern extension of Universal Boulevard.  The result was an interchange that directed a bulk of southbound Universal Blvd. traffic onto the Beachline, with only one lane passing under to connect to Orangewood Blvd.
