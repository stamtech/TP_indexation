He is perhaps most famous for whitewashing Stephen Hendry 9   0 in the 1998 Liverpool Victoria UK Championship, one the most surprising results in snooker's history. He followed this win with 9   6 win over Quinten Hann in the last 32.
He started the 2007/2008 season strongly by reaching the last 16 of the Grand Prix, coming through the qualifiers and beating players like Graeme Dott and Anthony Hamilton before his run ended in a 5   2 defeat to Joe Swail. He also reached the last 32 of the Welsh Open where he  beat Lee Spick, Ricky Walden and Gerard Greene and gave Ding Junhui a run for his money before Ding eventually won 5   4. He qualified for the 2008 Bahrain Championship before scoring a 147 in his wildcard match. He lost to eventual champion Neil Robertson in the last 32. He then qualified for the 2010 World Championship, where he lost 10   5 to Mark Williams.
Campbell won the first professional tournament of his career in Germany when he won Event 3 of the Euro Players Tour Championship beating Liang Wenbo 4&ndash;0 in the final. This result along with other consistent performances were enough to see him enter the top 32 in the rankings. He also qualified for the world championship for the second successive year, where he played Shaun Murphy. He subsequently lost 10-1 to Murphy.
