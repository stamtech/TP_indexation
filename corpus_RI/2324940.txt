When Rousso began playing poker seriously, she was a minor and too young to play in the casinos. Thus, she began playing online. This continued while she was in college. By the time she got to Miami law school in fall 2004, at age 21, she was able to play live poker at casinos and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino was within driving distance. She built her first stake at Hard Rock sit and go 10-player tables, where first prize was $250. From there, she was able to save for a $1,500 entry fee in Atlantic City in late 2005, which she parlayed into $17,500.

By 2007, Rousso was a notable poker star.  In October 2007, Rousso was part of a contingent of poker industry representatives and leaders of the 800,000-member Poker Players Alliance who flew to Washington, DC to attempt to convince the United States Congress to overturn the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.  The law compels financial institutions to monitor and stop their customers' cash transfers to unlawful online gaming sites.  The group met with both the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Committee on Financial Services.  She spoke in favor of a proposal by Barney Frank to license and regulate online gambling. The alliance also spoke in favor of the Skill Game Protection Act proposed by Robert Wexler to exempt poker, mah-jongg, chess, bridge and other games where contestants compete against each other rather than the "house" from the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. In May 2009, Frank, who had become the chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services in 2007, continued his efforts to "establish a framework to allow licensed gambling operators to process bets from players in the United States," with the support of the Poker Players Alliance and Harrah's Entertainment among others.

  In 2007, a $100 cap replaced a $2/bet limit. This cap still prohibits large tournaments with multi-thousand dollar buy-ins from occurring in Florida.

  Despite the scheduling difficulties of professional poker, Rousso attempts to maintain her physical fitness. Pokerstars approached ''Sports Illustrated'' about including a poker player in their Swimsuit edition. Rousso was sent to the Bahamas to be photographed by Sports Illustrated, but she appears in an advertisement in a bikini bottom and cutoff wetsuit top rather than in the editorial portion of the magazine.

Rousso confirmed on January 15, 2009 that she would appear in the February 10, 2009 issue.   Rousso's thoughts on the ''Sports Illustrated'' publicity was that "It was a great opportunity for poker in general and for me in particular."
