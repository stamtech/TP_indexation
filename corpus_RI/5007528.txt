The '''Downtown Santa Ana Historic Districts''' is a combination of local historic districts that was listed as one  in the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.   It is a  area. Also known as '''Historic Downtown District in Santa Ana''' is roughly bounded by Ross to French streets and First to Civic Center streets.

The Historic District in Downtown Santa Ana is characterized by a number of buildings in the Art Deco style as well as three old movie houses (The West End, Fox West Coast, and the Yost). Orange County's first Courthouse is also located here on Civic Center and Broadway streets. It is now a museum. The  is also located in this district and it is now home to the .
The Historical Downtown can be thought of as being characterized by a northern Institutional section and a southern retail section. The retail section has two distinct business districts namely the Artist's Village and the Fiesta Marketplace.
In recent years, efforts have been made to revitalize and beautify the Downtown's southern retail section by attracting new businesses and a higher economic class. It for many years has been a place for low income consumption (specifically Fourth street and some surrounding streets) and it unfortunately gained a stigma for some time but now things and attitudes towards it are changing.
