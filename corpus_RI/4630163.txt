The Barryville to Claryville series encompasses county routes 11 through 17 and 19, the non-suffixed of which form a continuous roadway between the two communities, passing through Liberty in between. Most of the routes are concurrent to New York State Route 55, which follows the Barryville-Claryville route from Barryville north to Curry. At Curry, CR 19 splits from NY 55 to access Claryville.
The lone suffixed route in the series, CR 11A, is a spur to New York State Route 97 from CR 11 in Barryville.
The Barryville to Narrowsburg series encompasses county routes 21 through 26. County routes 21 through 23 form a continuous roadway north to an intersection with NY 97 near Narrowsburg. After a portion of roadway solely occupied by NY 97, then NY 52/NY 97, CR 24 begins at the western terminus of the NY 52/NY 97 overlap and runs concurrent to NY 52 to the Pennsylvania state line.
CR 25 is a connector between NY 52 and NY 97 near Narrowsburg. CR 26 runs from the CR 22/CR 23 junction northeast to NY 55/CR 13 near Bethel. CR 21A is a spur to NY 97 from CR 21 in Barryville.
The Mongaup to Yulan series is only county routes 31 through 33, as routes 34 through 39 do not currently exist within the county. The roadway begins as CR 31 at NY 97 in Mongaup and continues to the northwest as CR 31, CR 32, and CR 33 to a junction with CR 21 and CR 22 in Yulan.
The Pond Eddy to Monticello series is made up of county routes 41 through 45 and 47 through 49, including CR 45A. The Pond Eddy-Monticello roadway begins at NY 97 in Pond Eddy and progresses north as county routes 41 through 45, from south to north, to a terminus at New York State Route 42 south of Monticello.
CR 47 is a spur off CR 32 from Eldred to Highland Lake. The route itself does not connect to any other route in the Pond Eddy-Monticello series; however, the unnumbered Mohican Lake Road continues east from the eastern terminus of CR 47 to intersect CR 42 near Glen Spey. CR 48 and CR 49 are designations for a connector that joins CR 43 and CR 44 in Fowlerville to Orange CR 7. CR 48 spans the segment from Fowlerville to CR 101; CR 49 covers the portion from CR 101 to the Orange County line. CR 45A is a short alternate route between CR 45 and NY 42 near Monticello.
The Liberty to Spring Glen series consists of county routes 51 through 59. County routes 51 through 55 follow a single roadway across eastern Sullivan County from Liberty to the Ulster County line, with a brief gap between CR 53 and CR 54 in Woodridge. In Ulster County, the road continues as the short CR 80, terminating at U.S. Route 209 in Spring Glen.
CR 56 is a connector between CR 54 and CR 172 near Mamakating Park. County routes 57 and 58, collectively Glen Wild Road, connect Woodridge to New York State Route 17  in Rock Hill. CR 59 is a connector between New York State Route 17B and CR 174 near Monticello and does not connect to any other route in the Liberty-Spring Glen series.
The New Vernon to Burlingham series, consists of routes 61   64. CR's 61 and 63 are the same road, known locally as New Vernon Road, running from a local road called North Road, to the Ulster County line, where it continues to route 52.
The route from Mongaup Valley to Liberty consists of the 70 series. Routes 71   73 consist of one roadway. The 71 portion is called Ferndale Road, while the 72   73 portion is known as Lt. J.G. Brender Highway. Between them, they run from NY 55/CR 15, to Crumley Road, a local road. CR's 74 and 75 conform, but are not connected to each other.
Unlike most numerical groupings in Sullivan County, the county routes numbered from 161 to 168 (161   164, 166, 166A, and 168 in actuality) do not form a series nor are most of them related. The designations are as follows:
The Roscoe to Bloomingburg series is made up of county routes 171 through 176, 178, and 179, plus three spur routes. All eight mainline routes are mostly continuous and collectively extend from the Delaware County line northwest of Roscoe to the Bloomingburg village line just west of the Orange County line. In between, the route serves Liberty, Monticello, and Wurtsboro via locally-maintained highways as the county designations end at the village limits. The series parallels the New York State Route 17 expressway for its entire length and also runs along the southern boundary of Catskill Park from Livingston Manor to the Delaware County line. The designations are split as follows, in numerical order and in southeast   northwest progression:
 In the vicinity of Wurtsboro, however, NY&nbsp;17 initially followed modern CR&nbsp;166. It was realigned between 1935 and 1938 to use what is now CR&nbsp;172 instead. Construction began in the early 1950s on a new limited-access alignment for NY&nbsp;17 through Sullivan County. Over the next 10 years, NY&nbsp;17 was realigned to follow the freeway as new sections of it opened up. By 1962, all of the modern Quickway from Parksville to Bloomingburg was complete and open to traffic. The highway was extended north to Livingston Manor (exit&nbsp;96) by 1964 and completed through Sullivan County by 1968.
