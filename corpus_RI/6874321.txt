Can I make a herbal infusion from the cannabis plant leaves.? 
Hi, I read just now on a hand dryer in a public toilet, that if you blow the hot air in your face, there is a risk of eye damage, from something called "fusion." What is the story here?   ( ) 08:36, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
I'm looking for an astronomical/celestial event for a story I'm writing. Thus far, I haven't been able to find anything that exactly fits what I'm looking for. My conditions are this: the event has to repeat every 200 to 300 years. It has to be visible from the same location on Earth. Also, I'd rather not go with a comet if I can help it. Can anyone give me some suggestions, or a pointer in the right direction? Thanks. --  ( ) 08:45, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
There's an ad on TV for "Debbie Meyer's Green Bags", which promise to almost stop fruits and veggies from rotting.  The claim is that they remove ethylene gas produced by food which would otherwise cause spoilage.  They also say the bags can be reused up to 10 times.  I'd like to know if these claims are legit:
Update: I found these reviews, which are mixed to negative: .  However, I'd still like to know more about the science that's going on with the bags, so still would like answers to the Q's above.   ( ) 12:50, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
Is the sole purpose of the large hadron collider to try to create black holes by accelerating hadrons to high speed and then crashing them into each other, or are there other experiments as well? 
Is it likely that there are hadrons of comparable energy inside the sun?  To put the question another way, is it likely that micro black holes are being created within the sun?  If so, would this be a common event or a rare one?  Thanks,   ( ) 16:04, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
Could we please have medical input to the discussion here:

This may be a rather simple answer - at the point it reaches the kidneys, perhaps - but the womens' Olympic marathon brought to mind a query I'd had from a number of years ago. I'd consumed two bottles of water walking in 95 degree F heat for a couple hours,a nd hardly had to use the bathroom at all; it had all been sweated out.
My question is, at what point does water consumed go from being utilized as sweat to being discarded as waste? My guess from both articles would be that anytime before it reaches eht kidneys, it's game for being sweat, but afterward, it's automatically urine, but I'm not sure; it almost seems like if you've really gotta go, and yet you're running a lot, it can still wind up used as sweat even if it's in the bladder. Is the answer true for other liquids, too? Or, only with respect to the amount of water in them?   (Weird, the thing to sign wasn't illuminated before. Now it is.)   ( ) 19:03, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
Let's say that a person is incapacitated, cannot speak, and has absolutely no idea where they are (as a result of an accident or a crime or for whatever reason). The only thing the person can manage to do is to dial "911" on a telephone.  '''Scenario A:''' If that person dials 911 from a landline phone, my understanding is that the 911 dispatchers can tell immediately what the location of the landline phone is.  And, if the incapacitated person does not speak (after having made the 911 call), they will still dispatch help to the correct address.  Is all of that correct?  '''Scenario B:''' Now, what exactly happens if the 911 call was made from a cell phone?  Does anyone know how exactly this works?  I assume -- at some point -- and through technology -- they can somehow locate the cell phone and the person.  Now, will this take a few minutes, hours, days, weeks, what?  In other words ... in an emergency, how long would that incapacitated person expect to wait before help arrived, when summoning 911 from a cell phone?  Also, are there procedures (similar to the landline phone) where they dispatch help no matter what, even if the incapacitated person on the cell phone does not / cannot speak?  Thanks.

Thanks.  So, if the incapacitated person is on a cell phone and can't speak or offer any location clues ... how long would they have to wait for help to arrive?  Minutes, hours, days, weeks?  Thanks.   (  ( ) 11:07, 22 August 2008 (UTC))
Thanks for the input.  Much appreciated.   (  ( ) 03:57, 23 August 2008 (UTC))
Is that right? i heard reports that in the UK, if you dial 999 from a mobile you don't necessarily get put through to the right district (unlike if you rang from a landline). I.e. if you say you've been left for dead on George Street it's quite possible that an ambulance will show up in Edinburgh rather than London. Presumably if you didn't say anything the problem would be ten times worse. (i've also heard that this problem is solved if you dial 112 (the pan-european number) which doesn't quite seem right -have i been lied to?)   ( ) 20:25, 28 August 2008 (UTC)
In a typical solution of a crystal solid in a liquid e.g. salt in water, is there a change in the volume of the solvent as the crystal dissolves? - is any change the same as or proportional to the volume of solute?     Preceding   comment added by   (       ) 20:34, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

Does optical zoom refer to distances or area? If I have a *4 zoom and take a picture of a square "zoomed out" and it is 100*100 pixels, when "zoomed in" by *4 will it be 400*400 or 200*200? --   ( ) 21:19, 21 August 2008 (UTC)
