The  is an official quality mark of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), developed with  to overcome the varying testing and certification requirements in different EU countries. It guarantees the quality of solar thermal products (see solar hot water), in particular panels or complete compact systems.
The Keymark certifies compliance of a product with the relevant European norms and requires independent tests by an accredited test institute and the existence of a quality management system comparable to ISO 9000. This avoids manufacturers needing to test/certify their products repeatedly depending on the local requirements.
By February 2008 more than two thirds of the panels on the market were Solar Keymark certified, and the acceptance of the scheme was still increasing. The scheme has been much less successful in certifying complete systems, primarily because each system configuration must be tested separately and the costs become prohibitive. ESTIF association expects that more and more public authorities in Europe will accept any Keymarked products as eligible for incentive schemes.
