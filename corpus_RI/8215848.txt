  Slim called upon his connections and friendships with poker's elite to start a new tournament in the February 1979.  Before the SBOP had developed a reputation of its own, many of the most respected names in poker attended the tournament "more to support Slim and take advantage of the very fat cash games the event would obviously inspire."  Slim modelled his SBOP after the WSOP with several events and a $10,000 Texas Hold'em Main Event. 
One of the principal differences between the WSOP and the SBOP was the prize structure.  The WSOP's prize structure was flat ensuring more people received smaller pieces of the prize pool.  The SBOP typically used a 60-30-10 payout structure.  In other words, only the first three places received money and generally in the ratio of 60% to first place, 30% to second place, and 10% to third.  This payment schedule predominated the SBOP for the first 5 years of the event, but as the event grew the number of payouts increased while keeping the payout schedule top heavy.
Three Poker Hall of Famers played at the final table in the $200 Pot Limit Omaha event.  Johnny Chan was a relative newcomer compared to the older veterans Jack Keller and Johnny Moss, but Chan succeeded in defeating both to claim the title.  Chan later made it to another final table and played against future future Hall of Famer, Barbara Enright at the $200 No Limit Hold'em.  Neither one won the event.
