Tord Bernhard Hagen was known to his friends as Bill, a nickname given to him as a young student in Uppsala. He lost his father early and his mother Ellen Hagen raised him and his sister Helga while pursuing a career in politics.
After graduating from Uppsala University, Bill went on to pursue a career as a diplomat by joining the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His first deployment was at the Swedish embassy in London where he directly experienced the outbreak of World War 2 and the subsequent German bombings. He served as an attache at the embassy from April 1939 to 1943. He also spent a few months in 1939 as substitute to the general counsel in Dublin.
Bill would continue his career by spending the majority of his life abroad. In the forties and fifties he served at the Swedish legations in Ankara, Prague and Bonn. In Prague, he experienced the rise of communist influence in Eastern Europe and in Bonn he saw the development of Western European cooperation. 
Despite retiring from the ministry of foreign affairs in 1980 Bill continued working as he was appointed senior advisor to Volvo international where he spent several years working in Geneva and also made extensive travels to the Middle East.
After ending his assignment at Volvo Bill began penning his memoirs which resulted in the book    Ett liv i krig och fred    (A life in war and peace) which was published in 2000.
In June 1995 Bill appeared in the BBC documentary    Myths and memories of World War 2" discussing the potential peace-treaty between England and Germany in 1940.
