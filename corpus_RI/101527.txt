Ho-Ho-Kus ranks the 15th highest in New Jersey according to per-capita income. Its wealthiest neighbor, Saddle River, is ranked second.
In 2010, ''New Jersey Monthly'' magazine ranked Ho-Ho-Kus the 30th best place to live in the state of New Jersey, up from 41st in 2008.
The meaning of the name Ho-Ho-Kus is in dispute. From the official history on the Borough's website, the most likely origin is a contraction of the Delaware Indian term "Mah-Ho-Ho-Kus" (or "Mehokhokus"), meaning "the red cedar."
Other meanings have been suggested over the years and are listed on the Borough's website, including an Indian word for running water, a cleft in the rock or under the rock or hollow rock, the word "hohokes," signifying the whistle of the wind against the bark of trees, the Chihohokies Indians whose chief lived here, the Dutch Hoog Akers for high acorns or Hoge Aukers, Dutch for high oaks, the Indian word "hoccus" meaning fox, or "woakus," gray fox, or that the "Ho" part means joy or spirit, and the rest of the name from "hohokes," meaning a kind of bark of a tree.
A constant source of confusion has been the manner in which the borough's name has been spelled, with each syllable capitalized and separated by hyphens. The confusion is only exacerbated by the existence of Hohokus Township, which comprised the area of present-day Ho-Ho-Kus and other surrounding communities, yet was spelled without the multiple capitalization or the hyphens.  Ho-Ho-Kus is serviced by interchange 168 on the Garden State Parkway which spells the municipality as Hohokus on its exit signing.
The name "Ho-Ho-Kus" was used explicitly in the resolution requesting a change of name passed by the Borough Council on October 12, 1908 and submitted to the Secretary of State of New Jersey requesting "That the Borough now known as the Borough of Orvil be hereafter known as the Borough of Ho-Ho-Kus..."
A few theories have been offered for the hyphens and capitalization. One is that it was intended to differentiate between the Borough and Hohokus Township which was formed on April 9, 1849, continued to exist until November 7, 1944, when a referendum was passed changing the name to present-day Mahwah. Another explanation was that it was meant to avoid confusion by postal clerks with mail being sent to Hoboken.
While efforts had been made in the ensuing decades to change the name or to alter the way in which the name of the borough is spelled, the Borough remains as "Ho-Ho-Kus."
