In 1984, WJBL-FM 94.5 made a dramatic format change from religious programming to CHR as WKLQ. "Hit Rock KLQ" battled WGRD for Grand Rapids' teen audience during the late 1980s and occasionally beat WGRD in the ratings, but by the summer of 1989 the station had shifted into a more AOR direction.  By the mid 1990s, the format became alternative rock and gradually became more active rock oriented towards the year 2000.  The station played an active rock format, including classic rock-oriented songs as well as more contemporary releases.
WKLQ created the very successful "Q Morning Zoo" in 1984, which at the time featured Robert J. Wright, Sarah Wilson, and Jim Owen.  Owen left the Q Zoo in 1987 to concentrate on his duties off air at KLQ and was replaced by Grand Rapids radio legend Rick Beckett.  When Wright left the station, he was replaced by Jay Allen.  In 1989, Wilson left the station and was replaced by Darla Jaye.  In 1993, Allen left the station to work at WOOD (AM) and he was replaced by Scott Winters.  For three consecutive years beginning in 1992, the Q Zoo was the number one rated morning show in Grand Rapids according to Arbitron.  On September 12, 1995, the entire Q Zoo resigned and less than two weeks later went on the air at rival station WGRD.
In 1996, WKLQ started airing the Howard Stern Show. In 2002 Matt Hanlon, took over as station General Manager. Around Christmas 2002, the station quietly moved Stern to its lower-powered AM sister, WBBL. As a result, WKLQ didn't have a morning show for months, until they hired Ron & Don Show from Seattle who stayed with the station until 2005. 
On October 11, 2004, WKLQ was moved from 94.5 FM to 107.3 FM in the Grand Rapids market, displacing sister station WODJ, which played oldies music. WTNR replaced WKLQ on 94.5 FM as a country music station.
Shortly before KLQ's move to 107.3 FM, They hired Justice and Jim for mornings. In Summer 2005, the duo created a vast amount of controversy when they announced on the air that they were going to drown a dog. The announcement persuaded several listeners to call 911. A day later, they announced that it was only a stunt.
On July 19, 2006, Justice and Jim were fired and replaced by The Opie and Anthony Show. 
In fall of 2007, WKLQ returned to its roots of playing the most new Rock in Grand Rapids.  On July 17, 2008, WKLQ launched Grey & Kluck mornings featuring Grand Rapids market veteran, Michael Grey, and Warren Kluck.  Grey serves as the Program Director of WKLQ.  Kluck spent three years previously doing morning drive at WRKR-FM in Kalamazoo, MI. 
Repeater station WKOQ (92.5 FM) signed on the air on August 15, 2005.  It transmitted from the same tower as television station WZZM in Newaygo County, near Grant. The simulcast was terminated on May 1, 2006.  92.5 FM subsequently became WLAW-FM, "The Outlaw," airing a blend of country music and Southern Rock.
On May 28, 2009, WKLQ was replaced on 107.3 FM by sister station WBBL, which was previously on the AM dial, and WKLQ was made an exclusive web-station. The Grey and Kluck Morning show was pulled off the air. Warren Kluck went to do the Kevin Matthews Morning Show. Michael Grey went on to The Starting Line Up with Bret Bakita. 
This move left a current void in the West Michigan area for new active rock enthusiasts and left its competitor (97.9 WGRD) the main source for new rock in this area. However, competitor WBFX 101.3 FM, owned by Clear Channel Communications, reacted to the loss of WKLQ by adding more music from the 1990s and later to its rotation, tweaking from a pure classic rocker to a gold-based mainstream rock outlet.
As of October 31, 2009 wklq.com has been shut down leaving the former active rock radio station completely gone. Users trying to access the website are redirected to its sister station, WLAV at wlav.com. 96.9 FM WLAV is a classic rock station owned by Citadel Broadcasting, the owners of former WKLQ.
