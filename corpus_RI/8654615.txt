The '''Sun Ship (Das Sonnenschiff)''' is the first positive energy commercial building in the world. Built in 2004, this solar powerhouse stands in Freiburg im Breisgau's renowned Vauban quarter and was designed by architect Rolf Disch who also built the Heliotrope.
This steel structured construction is called the Sun Ship as its skyline reminds the observer of a freight ship.
Its climatic design allows it to stay cool in the summer and store heat in the winter.
The groundfloor is used for high-end retail and commercial space.  The next three floors are used as office and commercial space, while nine penthouses on its rooftop offer residential space (112 to 300 sq. meters).  This unique integration of retail, commercial and residential space, all with a carbon-free footprint and a positive energy balance demonstrate the superior quality of Rolf Disch Solar Architecture.
The energy needs of the building are reduced by its 3-pane windows and Vacuum Insulation Panels (aka VIP). A highly efficient heat recovering ventilation system ensures air renewal while limiting energy loss. Computer simulations rate the heating requirements to between 10 and 20 kWh/sq. meter per year.
About 1 000 sq. meters (i.e. 135 kWp) of photovoltaic solar panels are installed on the Sun Ship altogether. This electricity production allows the building to be energy positive.
Heat is produced by a city quarter wood-chip heat and power plant (cogenerative) located some 100 meters away from the community center.
Apart from the nine penthouses, the Sun Ship houses several companies such as high-end supermarket Alnatura, a DM drug store and such institutions as Okostrom and the non-profit Oko-Institut.
