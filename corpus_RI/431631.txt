The '''Birmingham Outer Circle''' is a roughly circular, 27 mile (43&nbsp;km) bus route in Birmingham, England (a small section crosses into Sandwell). It mainly follows the city's outer ring road, the A4040 with some small deviations to serve some rail stations and shopping areas.
The main operator on the route is National Express West Midlands. Following de-regulation in 1986 several companies have competed on sections of this route. However only Falcon Travel, Serverse Travel and AM PM Travel have traversed the entire route.
Buses on the Outer Circle travel both clockwise (service 11C) and anti-clockwise (11A). The route is operated by National Express West Midlands, usually with Volvo B7TL/Wrightbus double-decker buses. The number 11 is Europe's longest urban bus route and first came into existence as two routes in 1923: the no.10 ran from King's Heath to the King's Head (Hagley Road) via Cotteridge, and the no.11 from Six ways Erdington to Acocks Green and Moseley. The route was first operated as a complete circle on 26 April 1926, the idea being to better link the suburbs of Birmingham, as most routes at that time travelled in and out of the city D.Harvey, M. Hanson and P. Drake ''Outer Circle - Birmingham's No.11 Bus Route". Tempus, 2003 The route passes such landmarks as Cadbury's in Bournville, one of the world's largest chocolate factories. The service is run commercially. 
A full circuit takes 3hrs to complete, and the service carries 50,000 passengers each day. There are 266 bus stops on the route. The route serves 233 schools, colleges or universities, 69 leisure and community facilities, 40 pubs, 19 retail centres, 6 hospitals, and one prison. It also links some 15 commercial centres.
The route was upgraded in 2004 by Centro. Over   25 million was spent on CCTV coverage, bus priority measures, new shelters with electronic information displays and new low-floor buses.
Service 11A/C run every 7/8 minutes during the day, every 20 minutes during evenings & the majority of Sundays (excluding afternoons) and every 15 minutes during Sunday afternoons.
Some of Wright Eclipse Geminis used on route 11A/C have green 'Every 8 minutes' branding.
AM PM Travel began operating on the service in October 2009, increasing the frequency of their route in December. Six re-furbished Volvo Olympian buses have been entered onto the new service fitted with Wi-Fi technology.
The route is traversed annually by a cavalcade of vintage buses. Run by the Aston Manor Transport Museum, the event began in 1977 and has continued each year since with the exception of 2000, in which it was cancelled due to a national fuel shortage.
The Birmingham band Woodbine's eponymous 1999 album features the track "Outer Circle", a tribute to the bus route. In 2001 a group of musicians from Birmingham created a concert based on the route.
The outer circle is the traditional route for the BRMB Walkathon, a sponsored walk which raises funds for charity.
On 11 November 2008 (starting at 11am), humourist Jon Bounds spent eleven hours travelling the route, documenting his journey online, using Twitter, Facebook and a blog, elevenbus.co.uk.
In October 2009 Kevin Beresford, a 57-year old resident of Birmingham, created a calendar dedicated to the anti-clockwise portion of the route.
