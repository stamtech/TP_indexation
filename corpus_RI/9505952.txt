A BBC World Service poll in 2010 showed that the image of the United States had increased by 10 percentage points from 2007 to 2010 and that the United States' presence was seen more as a positive than a negative influence for the first time since 2005. This results led Steven Kull, director of Program on International Policy Attitudes to state "After a year, it appears the 'Obama effect' is real." 
The description of this effect has been used as far back as 2008 when columnist David Brooks stated that "The Barack Obama effect is real" with regards to the increased approval of the United States since Obama became the Democratic nominee for president.
Following the defeat of Hezbollah in the June 2009 Lebanese elections, analysts from MSNBC and the ''New York Times'' attributed it in part to the "Obama effect"; specifically, the president's address in Cairo three days earlier, in which he sought to reach out to the Arab and Muslim world. Predictions of a similar pro-US result in the Iranian presidential election, however, failed to materialize.
