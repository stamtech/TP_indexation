Jumpcut had its offices in the SOMA district of San Francisco, California.
The name is derived from the jump cut, a video artifact that results from the splicing together of two separate parts of the same shot, or similar sections from two different shots.
Jumpcut was founded in 2005 and launched the Jumpcut.com website publicly on 5 April 2006.  Jumpcut was acquired by Yahoo! in October, 2006. 
In December 2008 Yahoo posted the following announcement on the JumpCut upload main page:
On April 15, 2009, Yahoo announced the closing of its service in an e-mail sent to its users:
After careful consideration, we will be officially closing the Jumpcut.com site on June 15, 2009. This was a difficult decision to make, but it   s part of the ongoing prioritization efforts at Yahoo!
Very soon, we   ll be releasing a software utility that will allow you to download the movies you created on Jumpcut to your computer. We   ll send instructions to this email address when the download utility is available...Thanks for your understanding and thanks for being a part of Jumpcut.
