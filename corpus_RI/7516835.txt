Ulf G. Linden was the CEO of Swedish chemical group Becker when he was hired by Volvo in 1979. Then, Volvo was the largest corporation in Sweden. Due to his tough management style, Linden was nicknamed "Pehr G. Gyllenhammar's hitman", especially after his role in turning down Volvo's merger with chemical group Fermenta. Linden retired from Volvo in 1987, to focus on the Linden group (which is the majority owner of Becker).
