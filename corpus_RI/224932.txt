Harry Blackmun was born in Nashville, Illinois, and grew up in Dayton's Bluff, a working-class neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He attended Harvard College on scholarship, earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics ''summa cum laude'' Phi Beta Kappa in 1929. While at Harvard, Blackmun joined Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity and sang with the Harvard Glee Club (with whom he performed for President Herbert Hoover in 1929, Blackmun's first visit to Washington). He attended Harvard Law School (among his professors there was Felix Frankfurter), graduating in 1932. He served in a variety of positions including private counsel, law clerk, and adjunct faculty at the University of Minnesota Law School and William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law). Blackmun's practice as an attorney at the law firm now known as Dorsey & Whitney focused in its early years on taxation, trusts and estates, and civil litigation. He married Dorothy Clark in 1941 and had three daughters with her, Nancy, Sally, and Susan. Between 1950 and 1959, Blackmun served as resident counsel for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
Blackmun was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Richard M. Nixon on April 4, 1970, and was confirmed by the Senate on May 12, 1970, by a 94   0 vote. He received his commission on May 14, 1970. His confirmation followed contentious battles over two previous, failed nominations forwarded by Nixon in 1969   1970, those of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell.
Blackmun, a lifelong Republican, was expected to adhere to a conservative interpretation of the Constitution. The Court's Chief Justice at the time, Warren Burger, a long-time friend of Blackmun's and best man at his wedding, had recommended Blackmun for the job to Nixon. The two were often referred to as the "Minnesota Twins" (a reference to the baseball team, the Minnesota Twins) because of their common history in Minnesota and because they so often voted together. Indeed, Blackmun voted with Burger in 87.5 percent of the closely-divided cases during his first five terms (1970 to 1975), and with Brennan, the Court's leading liberal, in only 13 percent.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 186. In 1972 Blackmun joined Burger and the other two Nixon appointees to the Court in dissenting from the ''Furman v. Georgia'' decision that invalidated all capital punishment laws then in force in the United States, and in 1976 he voted to reinstate the death penalty in  ''Gregg v. Georgia'', even the mandatory death penalty statutes, although in both instances he indicated his personal opinion of its shortcomings as a policy. Blackmun, however, insisted his political opinions should have no bearing on the death penalty's constitutionality.
That began to change, however, between 1975 and 1980, by which time Blackmun was joining Brennan in 54.5 percent of the divided cases, and Burger in 45.5 percent. Shortly after Blackmun dissented in ''Rizzo v. Goode'' (1976), William Kunstler embraced him and "welcom him to the company of the 'liberals and the enlightened.'" During the final five years that Blackmun and Burger served together, Blackmun joined Brennan in 70.6 percent of the close cases, and Burger in only 32.4 percent.
In 1973, Blackmun authored the Court's opinion in ''Roe v. Wade'', invalidating a Texas statute making it a felony to administer an abortion in most circumstances. The Court's judgment in the companion case of ''Doe v. Bolton'' held a less restrictive Georgia law to be unconstitutional also. Both decisions were based on the right to privacy announced in ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' (1965), and remain the primary basis for the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. ''Roe'' caused an immediate uproar, and Blackmun's opinion made him a target for criticism by opponents of abortion, receiving voluminous negative mail and death threats over the case.
Blackmun became a passionate advocate for abortion rights, often delivering speeches and lectures promoting ''Roe v. Wade'' as essential to women's equality and criticizing ''Roe'''s critics. Defending abortion, in ''Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'' Blackmun wrote: 
Ancillary to the primary right to abortion, Blackmun extended First Amendment protection to commercial speech in ''Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia'', a case where the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an editor who ran an advertisement for an abortion referral service.
After ''Roe'', Blackmun began to drift away from the influence of Chief Justice Warren Burger to increasingly side with liberal Justice William J. Brennan in finding constitutional protection for unenumerated individual rights. For example, Blackmun wrote a blistering dissent to the Court's opinion in 1986's ''Bowers v. Hardwick'', denying constitutional protection to homosexual sodomy (Burger wrote a concurring opinion in ''Bowers'' in which he said, "To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.") Burger and Blackmun drifted apart, and as the years passed, their lifelong friendship degenerated into a hostile and contentious relationship.
From the 1981 term through the 1985 term, Blackmun voted with Brennan 77.6 percent of the time, and with Thurgood Marshall 76.1%.Greenhouse, Linda. Becoming Justice Blackmun. Times Books. 2005. Page 235. From 1986 to 1990, his rate of agreement with the two most liberal justices was 97.1% and 95.8%.
Blackmun's judicial philosophy increasingly seemed guided by ''Roe'', even in areas where ''Roe'' was not directly applicable. His concurring opinion in 1981's ''Michael M. v. Superior Court'', a case that upheld statutory rape laws that applied only to men but did not implicate ''Roe'' or abortion, nonetheless included extensive citation of the Court's recent abortion cases.
Despite his stated personal "abhorrence" for the death penalty in ''Furman v. Georgia'', he voted to uphold mandatory death penalty statutes at issue in 1976's ''Roberts v. Louisiana'' and ''Woodson v. North Carolina'', even though these laws would have automatically imposed the death penalty on anyone found guilty of first-degree murder. But on February 22, 1994, less than two months before announcing his retirement, Blackmun announced that he now saw the death penalty as always and in all circumstances unconstitutional by issuing a dissent from the Court's refusal to hear a routine death penalty case (''Callins v. Collins''), declaring that "rom this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death." Subsequently, adopting the practice begun by Justices Brennan and Marshall, he issued a dissent from denial of certiorari in every death penalty case, citing and reiterating his ''Callins'' dissent. As Linda Greenhouse and others have reported, Blackmun's law clerks prepared what would become the ''Callins'' dissent well in advance of the case coming before the Court; Blackmun's papers indicate that work began on the dissent in the summer of 1993, and in a memo preserved in Blackmun's papers, the clerk writing the dissent wrote Blackmun that 
Blackmun and his clerks then sought an appropriate case to serve as a "vehicle for  dissent," and settled on ''Callins''. That the case found the dissent, rather than the more traditional relationship of the dissent relating to the case, is underscored by the opinion's almost total omission of reference to the case it ostensibly addressed: Callins is relegated to a supernumerary in his own appeal, being mentioned but five times in a 42-paragraph opinion     three times within the first two paragraphs, and twice in footnote 2.
In his emotional dissent in 1989's ''DeShaney v. Winnebago County'', rejecting the constitutional liability of the state of Wisconsin for four-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was beaten until brain-damaged by his abusive father, Blackmun famously opined, "Poor Joshua!" In his dissent in 1993's ''Herrera v. Collins'', where the Court refused to find a constitutional right for convicted prisoners to introduce new evidence of "actual innocence" for purposes of obtaining federal relief, Blackmun argued in a section joined by no other justice that "The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder."
Blackmun has been noted for the fact that compared to other Justices on the Supreme Court, he has let his law clerks utilize great latitude as far as writing opinions for him, such as his opinion in ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' which was written by Stephanie Dangel, now a lawyer in Pennsylvania. Blackmun's Casey opinion draft included sharp criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist, which included, according to Dangel, a sarcastic reference to Rehnquist as "The Chief" rather than Chief Justice because "I have my doubts as to whether he deserves to be called 'justice' on this one." Dangel, however, changed it to "Chief Justice" at the urging of Justice Anthony Kennedy.
It has also been revealed by Blackmun in a 1995 oral history with Harold Koh that his dissent in ''Bowers v. Hardwick'' was written by a clerk, Pam Karlan. Blackmun said of the dissent; "arlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct."
When Blackmun's papers were released at the Library of Congress, his sometimes negative notations regarding fellow Justice Clarence Thomas came to light.
Blackmun announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in April 1994, four months before he officially left the bench. By then, he had become the court's most liberal justice. In his place, President Bill Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer who was confirmed by the Senate 87-9.
Blackmun is the only Supreme Court justice to have played one in a motion picture. In 1997, he portrayed Justice Joseph Story in the Steven Spielberg film ''Amistad''.
On February 22, 1999, Blackmun fell in his home and broke his hip. The next day, he underwent hip replacement surgery at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Virginia, but he never fully recovered. Ten days later, on March 4, at the age of 90, he died at 1&nbsp;am from complications following the procedure. He was buried five days later at Arlington National Cemetery. His wife died seven years later on July 13, 2006, at the age of 95, and was buried next to him.
In 2004 the Library of Congress released his voluminous files. Blackmun had kept all the documents from every case, notes the Justices passed between themselves, 10 percent of the mail he received, and numerous other documents. After Blackmun announced his retirement from the Court, he recorded a 38-hour oral history with one of his former law clerks, former Yale Law School dean Harold Koh, which was also released. In it, he discusses his thoughts on everything from his important Court cases to the Supreme Court piano, though some Supreme Court experts such as David Garrow have cast doubt on the accuracy of some of Blackmun's recollections, especially his thoughts on the Court's deliberations on ''Roe v. Wade''.
Based on these papers, Linda Greenhouse of ''The New York Times'' wrote ''Becoming Justice Blackmun''. Jan Crawford's ''Supreme Justice'' also draws heavily from the papers.
