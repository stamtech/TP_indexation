Although SR 91 is an east&ndash;west road, it inherited its odd (as opposed to even) route number from the now mostly decommissioned U.S. 91 which passed through the Inland Empire in a northeasterly direction on its way to Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and points beyond. Those segments of U.S. 91 are now parallel to, or have been replaced altogether by, Interstate 15 (I-15).
The area from post mile 10.4 to 11.1 is known as the Juanita Millender-McDonald Highway.
From the Harbor Freeway to its intersection with the Long Beach Freeway in northern Long Beach, SR 91 is named the Gardena Freeway. Between the Long Beach Freeway and its intersection with the Santa Ana Freeway at the Fullerton-Anaheim border, it is named the Artesia Freeway.  From the Santa Ana Freeway to its eastern terminus at the intersection of the Pomona, Moreno Valley, and Escondido Freeways, it is named the Riverside Freeway.
The '''Gardena Freeway''' is a short freeway in southern Los Angeles County.  It is the westernmost freeway portion of State Route 91.  It begins just west of the Harbor Freeway at the intersection with Vermont Avenue in the eastern edge of the city of Gardena, proceeding eastward approximately six miles (10&nbsp;km) until it intersects the Long Beach Freeway.  Nearby the exit to Acacia Avenue, Artesia Boulevard meets with the Blue Line at its station.  Thereafter, SR 91 is known as the Artesia Freeway.
Until 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the '''Redondo Beach Freeway'''.  The name change reflected the successful efforts of the cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach to block the extension of the freeway westward to its intended terminus at the cancelled '''Pacific Coast Freeway''' in Redondo Beach. In 1997, the California government dedicated the portion of the 91 between Alameda Rd and Central Ave to former assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr.
The '''Artesia Freeway''' is a freeway in southeastern Los Angeles County and northwestern Orange County.  It is signed as State Route 91 for its entire length.  It runs east&ndash;west from its western terminus at the Long Beach Freeway in northern Long Beach to its eastern terminus at the Santa Ana Freeway at the Fullerton-Anaheim border.  (SR 91 continues west of the Long Beach Freeway as the Gardena Freeway, and east of the Santa Ana Freeway as the Riverside Freeway.)  The "Artesia Freeway" name originally was assigned to the entire length of SR 91 west of the Santa Ana Freeway in the early 1970s since it was, in sense, the freeway realignment of SR 91 from the paralleling '''Artesia Boulevard'''.
During the 1984 Summer Olympics, a  stretch of the highway was home to the cycling men's road team time trial event.
As the only freeway to link Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, the 91 is one of the most heavily congested routes in Southern California.
Between the Santa Ana Freeway, Interstate 5 (I-5), in Buena Park and the 91 Freeway's eastern terminus at a junction with Interstate 215 and State Route 60 in Riverside, the 91 Freeway's assigned name is the '''Riverside Freeway'''. Past the I-215/CA-60/CA-91 junction, the Riverside Freeway continues as I-215.
The Riverside Freeway was first opened in 1963 signed as U.S. Route 91 and U.S. Route 395 and the last section was built in 1975.
Opening in 1995, the 91 Express Lanes was the first privately-funded tollway built in the United States since the 1940s, and the first fully automated tollway in the world.  Tolls are collected when a vehicle carrying a transponder mounted on the inside of the vehicle's windshield passes beneath the toll 'booth' (actually a transceiver array above the toll lanes  that is located at about the five-mile (8&nbsp;km) point of the toll road).  Other characteristics of the toll road include: variable toll based on day and time (i.e. higher toll during peak periods) with road signs alerting users to the toll to be paid; an alignment contained entirely within the median of the existing Riverside Freeway with two lanes in each direction; limited access provided only at the east and west ends of the toll road (where the toll lanes become regular carpool lanes; and separation between the regular, main lanes of the Riverside Freeway is provided  by reflective yellow,  high, plastic lane markers (as opposed to concrete barriers or a similar solid barrier)).
The Arrowhead Trail, an auto trail connecting Salt Lake City with Los Angeles, initially took a longer route via present US 95 and former US 66 between Las Vegas and Needles, as the more direct Old Spanish Trail was in very poor condition. The "Silver Lake cutoff", which would save about 90 miles (145&nbsp;km), was proposed by 1920, and completed in 1925 as an oiled road by San Bernardino County. The Bureau of Public Roads and the state of Nevada both urged its inclusion in the state highway system, the former as part of the federal aid highway connecting Salt Lake City and Los Angeles,California Highway Advisory Committee and Arthur Hastings Breed, Report of a Study of the State Highway System of California, California State Printing Office, 1925, p. 97 and the state legislature did that in 1925, with it becoming an extension of Route 31. (Across the state line, State Route 6 continued through Las Vegas to Arizona.) The initial plan for the U.S. Highway system simply stated that Route No. 91 would run from Las Vegas "to an intersection with Route No. 60" (which became US 66 in 1926),Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 but in 1926 the cutoff was chosen, ending at US 66 at Daggett, just east of Barstow. , November 11, 1926American Association of State Highway Officials, United States Numbered Highways, ''American Highways'', April 1927 (The roadway south from Las Vegas later became part of US 95.) The route was added to the federal-aid secondary system in 1926,Los Angeles Times, Silver Lake Cut-off to Get Federal Aid, February 14, 1926, p. G5 which helped pay for a mid-1930s widening and paving, including some realignments (parts of the old road are now known as Arrowhead Trail). The new routing generally followed the present I-15, except through Baker (where it used Baker Boulevard) and into Barstow (where it followed former SR 58 to First Avenue, ending at Main Street, which carried US 66).United States Geological Survey, , , and 
US 91 was extended southwest to Long Beach in the late 1940s. Beginning at Barstow, the extension overlapped US 66 over Cajon Pass to San Bernardino. From San Bernardino west through Riverside and Santa Ana Canyon to Olive, the state took over a mostly-paved county highway in 1931 as part of an extension of Route 43 to Newport Beach via Santa Ana. Two branches leading west from Route 43 near Olive along mostly-constructed county roads were added in 1933: '''Route 175''' along Orangethorpe Avenue and Artesia Boulevard from near the mouth of the canyon west to Route 60 (now SR 1) in Hermosa Beach (unconstructed through Compton until the mid-1950s), and '''Route 178''' along Lincoln Avenue and Carson Street from Olive west to Route 168 (now SR 19) in Lakewood. When state routes were marked in 1934, Route 175 became '''Sign Route 14''', and Sign Route 18 included all of Route 178 and most of Route 43 into the San Bernardino Mountains. When US 91 was extended to Long Beach, it overlapped SR 18 from San Bernardino to Lakewood, where it turned south along SR 19 to the Los Alamitos Traffic Circle. There it turned west along US 101 Alternate to near downtown Long Beach, where it ended at SR 15 (Atlantic Avenue), at a terminus shared with US 6. (This routing along SR 19 and US 101 Alt. also became an extension of SR 18.)H.M. Gousha Company, , 1955H.M. Gousha Company, , 1953
In 1935, the state improved the alignment between Fairmont Boulevard and Gypsum Canyon Road, including a bypass of the old road, which curved along the south slope of the canyon, east of Weir Canyon Road. In the late 1930s, the Prado Dam project resulted in the bypassing of a longer section, replacing Prado Road, an abandoned road curving to the east end of the dam, Pomona Rincon Road, Auto Center Drive, Pomona Road, and Yorba Street with the present Green River Road, Palisades Drive, part of SR 91, and 6th Street.United States Geological Survey, , surveyed 1933, "routes usually traveled" as of 1941United States Geological Survey, , surveyed 1933, "routes usually traveled" as of 1941
Prior to 1991, the Gardena Freeway was known as the '''Redondo Beach Freeway''', referring to Caltrans's original intention for the freeway portion of the route to continue all the way to the never-built Pacific Coast Freeway.
Also, before 1997, the 91 continued all the way to State Route 1 in Hermosa Beach, which Metro Local line 130 runs through. At that time, the route became discontinuous in Gardena, the portion between Vermont Avenue and Western Avenue being turned over to the city. In 2003, the western portion, from SR 1 to Western Ave. was relinquished to the local jurisdictions. The first segment of the freeway was made in 1965 signed as US 91, and the last segment was made in 1975.
By the early 1990s, rapid development of the areas of the Inland Empire around Riverside had made the Riverside Freeway&mdash;which is the sole freeway connecting the working class, bedroom communities and industrial areas of the Inland Empire to the wealthy suburbs and commercial centers of Orange County&mdash;one of the most congested in the Greater Los Angeles region.  In response, a private consortium created the 91 Express Lanes, a fully automated, RFID-activated tollway contained entirely within the median of the existing Riverside Freeway.  This route operates between the Orange/Riverside county line and the Costa Mesa Freeway interchange in eastern Anaheim.  Opening in 1995, the 91 Express Lanes were the first privately funded tollway built in the United States since the 1940s, and the first fully automated tollway in the world.  In 2003, their ownership and operation was taken over by the Orange County Transportation Authority.
Testing evaluations are slated to begin in the winter of 2007 for a tunnel proposal, currently called the Irvine-Corona Expressway proposal, designed to carry traffic from Interstate 15 south of Corona near Cajalco Road to  California State Route 241 near Irvine. One concept for this project specifies a set of three tunnels   two for cars and one for both trucks and high-speed light rail   that would stretch for , burrowing beneath the Santa Ana mountain range, and carrying up to 70,000 cars a day between California   s Riverside and Orange counties.
Numerous other projects are currently underway or in the planning phases for distant completion, some as far out as the year 2030. They can be found  and explained in the .
