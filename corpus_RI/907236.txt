After his departure from Formula 1, Brancatelli went on to race in several Touring Car series, with some success. Along with Swedish driver Thomas Lindstrom he won the 1985 European Touring Car Championship driving a Volvo 240 Turbo for Rudi Eggenberger, the pair winning six out of fourteen races. He drove a Rover Vitesse for TWR in the 1986 ETCC and a BMW M3 for Italian outfit CiBiEMME Sport in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship where he partnered another former Formula One driver Johnny Cecotto to win the 500&nbsp;km de Bourgogne at Dijon-Prenois. He finished 9th in that championship while finishing 5th in the 1987 ETCC. The following season saw Brancatelli on the move again, this time going back to Eggenberger Motorsport where he would serve as a driver in the teams 3rd Texaco Ford Sierra RS500. Brancatelli would also win the 1988 Italian Touring Car Championship driving a privately entered Alfa Romeo 75.
Other than his success in the 1985 ETCC, arguably Brancatelli's biggest wins in touring car racing were the 1985 Guia Race of Macau driving a Volvo 240 Turbo and the 1989 Spa 24 Hours driving an Eggenberger Ford Sierra RS500 along with Bernd Schneider and Win Percy.  He would continue racing until his retirement in the late 1990s.
