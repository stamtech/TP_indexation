Mountain Goat beers have found success at the Australian International Beer Awards and the brewery has been awarded the Premier's Trophy for Best Victorian Beer three times: twice for the ''Surefoot Stout'' (in 2004 and 2006), and most recently (in 2009) for ''Rapunzel''.http://www.beerawards.com/results.asp
Mountain Goat Beer remains independent, with approximately 12 shareholders - largely friends and family of its founders.http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20144299-5000920,00.html The brewery's turnover now exceeds A$1,000,000 per annum  and it employs approximately 12 full-time staff http://www.smh.com.au/news/good-living/spin-the-bottle/2008/03/24/1206206995915.html.
The origins of Mountain Goat Beer go back to the early 1990s, when founder Dave Bonighton was home-brewing in his backyard in Elsternwick, Victoria; friend and fellow founder Cam Hines was travelling throughout Canada when he was struck by the range of micro-brewed beer available at various bars in Vancouver. Seeing the possibilities for a microbrewery in his hometown in Melbourne, Cam contacted Dave, suggesting they open a brewery.
By September 1996, Mountain Goat beer was ready to taste-test three beers - ''The Leroy Brown Ale'', ''Sheik-It-Out Stout'' and ''Golden Boy'' - at a gallery space in Melbourne. The success of this venture suggested the original idea might be viable.
Lacking the money to invest in their own brewery, the first Mountain Goat beers were brewed using excess capacity first at the Scottish Chief brew-pub in Geelong and then at the larger Grand Ridge microbrewery in  Mirboo North Victoria  and in October 1997, Hightale Ale was commercially released.
By 1999, the brewery was able to raise funds to move to their original premesis in Crown St, Richmond, effectively relocating the equipment from the defunct brewing operations at the Geebung Polo Club in Hawthorn, Victoria.
At the end of 2004, Mountain Goat beer moved to their much larger current premesis, in North St, Richmond. The North St site is around 1200m2:  a little over three times the size of the older brewery.
The Mountain Goat brewery operates out of a converted red brick warehouse in the inner-city suburb of Richmond. The site is home to the brewing operation as well as sales, administrative and management staff.
As with an increasing number of microbreweries in Australia, the brewery is open to the public two nights a week, with a licence allowing them to sell liquor on-site. Their liquor also licence allows them to operate as a private function venue. Brewery tours are also offered.
The brewery has been widely promoted as a tourism attraction and has been featured in the Victorian Government's ''Beer Lover   s Guide to Victoria   s Microbreweries'' publication  and in television travel shows.
Mountain Goat brewery has taken many steps to reduce - and in some cases eliminate - their impact on the environment.
Moving to new premises in 2004 gave the company the opportunity to set up up the brewery with the environment in mind, from using recycled materials in their fit-out through to installation of solar panels and an 11,000 litre rainwater tank. 
Their seven solar panels came at cost of $15,000 (with the aid of a 50% government grant) and can pre-heat brewing water to around 55   C, reducing the use of mains power, and it is estimated the brewery's use of collected rainwater saves approximately 250,000 litres of water annually.
The brewery also pH neutralises waste water and have all but eliminated steam and odour emissions that are a by-product of the brewing process.
The company operates an incentive scheme encouraging their staff to cycle to work as part of their environmental program. Each staff member is given a $200 subsidy each year for bike maintenance and equipment; and a further bonus of $1.50 for each day they ride to work, paid as part of the annual Christmas bonus.
All Mountain Goat beers are vegan friendly  (no animal products are used in their production), and free from preservatives and additives.
The regularly brewed beers are available in 50 litre kegs and also packaged in 330 millilitre brown glass bottles - or  stubbies - for retail sale. In turn, their stubbies are available packaged in lots of six in an open cardboard one piece carton, with carry-handle (known as a ''six pack''). Four six packs may also be purchased in a closed cardboard carton (known in Australia as a ''slab'').
Seasonal and one-off beers are available in 50 litre kegs and often bottled in ''longneck'' bottles (known as Rare Breed releases) - which are 640ml.
The beer won the Trophy for Best Draught Ale at the 2000 Australian International Beer Awards (as well as a Gold medal) and has been awarded silver medals in 2011, 2010, 2008, 2007, 2003, 2002 and 2000;  bronze medals in 2010, 2009, 2008, 2006, 2005, 2003,  2002 and 2001.
Hightail Ale has an alcohol content by volume of 4.5%.
On July 3, 2009 Mountain Goat announced the launch of their Steam Ale (replacing the India Pale Ale and Pale Ale in the regular line-up).
Steam Ale is a California Commons-style ale. Like the India Pale Ale before it, it is certified organic. It has an alcohol content by volume of 4.5%.
Steam Ale won two silver medals at the 2011 Australian International Beer Awards and a bronze medal in 2010.

Surefoot Stout was the third beer commercially released by the brewery. Surefoot is a seasonal beer, brewed through autumn and winter. Sold in 330ml bottles until 2009, it was first sold in 650ml bottles in June 2010.

Beers made in collaboration with other breweries (known as 'Cross Breed' releases).
Mountain Goat's second beer, the Pale Ale was a golden, full-strength pale ale, and was sold in both bottles and on tap until July, 2009 when it was announced it would be replaced by the organic Steam Ale.
Pale Ale was a consistent medal winner at the Australian International Beer Awards, picking up silver medals in 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2001; bronze medals in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2002 and 2001.
