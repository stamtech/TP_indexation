McKindless was founded in Newmains by Vincent and Margaret McKindless. It started as a small operation of a few buses, a lorry and 2 coaches in 1987. Its aim was to provide school contracts and private hires, but it quickly moved into local bus operation.  The first routes operated were:
These service were operated with ex-Highland Scottish front-engined Ford R1114s  and Leyland Nationals. In 1994 the routes and buses were bought by Kelvin Central Buses.
From 1996 Mckindless started a commuter shuttle between Wishaw and Glasgow. and restarted the original routes, and started services to Cleland and Lanark from 1997.
In 2000, the company expanded again by opening a depot in Parkhead, and started operating route with Glasgow city centre - Bishopbriggs - Kirkintilloch. By 2005 they had opened a new purpose-built depot in Parkhead and started route 62. The 62 route became their best route being very busy and operated by low floor vehicles.
From October a shadow of the former giant is to return, as JMB Travel begin to operate the route 41. JMB are part of the McKindless Group.
The company ceased operation of its services at 1900 hours on Friday 19 February, 2010. Many employees were not notified that the company was about to close, only discovering this when their shifts ended. The end of the company left 116 people unemployed. There were also allegations of tax fraud, with the Inland Revenue telling former employees that the company had not paid tax or national insurance contributions on their behalf since 2004. Company employees Peter McKenna and Jennifer McKindless were charged with defrauding HM Revenue & Customs of   113,467 between 2002 and 2004, and are due to face trial in late April 2010.
When it closed McKindless owned 110 vehicles comprising a large number of makes and models. They operated six regular frequency routes with a peak vehicle requirement of 65. Recent additions included several Alexander Dennis Enviro 200 Darts with Euro 4 low emission engines. Other vehicle types used include MCW Metrobus and Leyland Olympian double deckers and various single deckers such as Dennis Darts, Volvo B6s and Optare Excels. 
In late 2006 the company bought its first new vehicles: two BMC Falcons and a King Long single-decker. Their three express services were run with Volvo B10M and Dennis Javelin coaches. Two older vehicles, a Bristol Lodekka and an AEC Routemaster, were preserved by the company. McKindless had also bought ex-Hutchison Optare Excels to use on local routes in Wishaw, still in the livery of their previous. In July 2009, McKindless loaned an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double-decker for demonstration purposes.
Steady investment resulted in the operator providing 100% low-floor vehicles on their local service routes in Lanarkshire since 2007, while operations in Glasgow were nearly 100% low floor by 2009.
The McKindless Bus Group operated from its head office at Newmains and from a purpose built depot at Nuneaton Street, Parkhead.
