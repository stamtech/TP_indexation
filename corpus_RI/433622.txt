The first known appearance of Conan the Librarian is on the comedy show ''You Can't Do That on Television'' in the 1982 episode "Heroes."
Probably the first printed Conan the Librarian reference is in a 1987 ''Mother Goose and Grimm'' comic.  A pig returning a book to the "Overdue Books" section faces across the desk a scowling and muscle-bound librarian, in typical Conan the Barbarian dress, who from the placard on the desk we know is "Conan the Librarian."
Conan the Librarian appears in a sketch on a 1988 episode of the children's television series ''Reading Rainbow''.  Unlike the ''UHF'' Conan (see below), Conan the Librarian is helpful and shows someone how to get a library card.
Conan the Librarian also appears in a brief segment of the 1989 "Weird Al" Yankovic film ''UHF''. In the segment, the exaggeratedly muscular Guardian of the Shelves chastises   in German-accented English   a library patron who is unsuccessful in finding a book.  He then hefts his enormous sword and slices another patron in two for returning a book overdue.
In 1987, William Mitchell College of Law library staff created the character Conan the Librarian for a talent show performance, and subsequently wrote ''The Adventures of Conan the Librarian''.  This was followed by ''The Return of Conan the Librarian'' and ''Conan the Librarian on the Information Highway''.  The author of these stories is the fictitious "Hadley V. Baxendale" (a pun on the famous law case ''Hadley v. Baxendale'').
This Conan is an ordinary librarian who lives in the mythical "Information Age".
