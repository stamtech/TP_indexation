Prior to their merger with Telus Mobility, Clearnet had developed an innovative out of the box cell phone marketing system, where their phones were available at various retail stores, besides their own. To activate a Clearnet cell phone, a customer simply called the company with a credit card, went through an instant credit check, and if approved, they set up their Clearnet account over the phone.  Within an hour or two, the customer could use his or her mobile phone service.  Due to the current dominance of broadband Internet, many companies will charge more for activations in store or over the phone while reducing or eliminating online activation fees.
