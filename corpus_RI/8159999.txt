Each new property features roof mounted solar panels, rainwater harvesting tanks and two-storey    solar spaces   .
The houses are a timber frame construction, finished externally with rendered panels and cedar cladding. The double height "solar-spaces" are the most notable external feature. These were designed and installed by a specialist contractor.
Of the 75 dwellings, 30% of them are due to be affordable housing. This was a clear brief from Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.
