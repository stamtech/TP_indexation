Warren began playing professionally at age 14 in a local Washington, D. C. band led by his father, Edward Warren. He later worked with other local groups, including Stuff Smith's as well as with altoist and bandleader Rick Henderson at the historic Howard Theater on 7th and T Streets.
In 1958, he moved to New York City to play with Kenny Dorham, appearing on his first recording, with Dorham, in January 1960 with saxophonist Charles Davis, pianist Tommy Flanagan and drummer Buddy Enlow. He stayed in New York for the rest of his musical career, mainly as house bassist for Blue Note records.
A popular sideman, he also recorded with Miles Davis, Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, Sonny Clark, Dexter Gordon, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Jackie McLean, and Stanley Turrentine. He played with Thelonious Monk in 1963 and 1964 and then moved back to Washington, D.C., where he briefly worked in television before becoming seriously ill. 
Since his illness he has played professionally only occasionally. For the past few years he has played a regular gig at Columbia Station in Washington D.C.'s Adams Morgan neighborhood. 
He rarely soloed, preferring to accompany other musicians, and never recorded as a leader but performed as a sideman on many albums, including Dexter Gordon's ''Go'', Jackie McLean's ''Vertigo'' (1959) and ''Hipnosis'' (1967), and many recordings with Thelonious Monk.
