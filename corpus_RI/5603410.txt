The '''Samsung SCH-u540''' is a flip phone offered by Verizon Wireless and Telus.
While the design is similar to that of other phones offered in the past for Verizon, the phone differs from many VGA-only capable phones in that it offers the VCast music download service.
The phone comes with a 1.3 megapixel camera with a camera interface designed by Samsung. The camera controls are entirely customizable .
The phone features a flat design commonly found on other Samsung Cell phones of that era. The phone features bright lighting both in the display and in the keypad (with full configurable options for timeout) and even carries an onboard "hold" switch for the outside touch controls.
The User interface is an updated "2007" flavor. The phone is completely devoid of the red bars that were once common on Verizon phones .
