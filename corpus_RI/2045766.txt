Lund began playing poker tournaments in 1977 and won a bracelet at the 1978 World Series of Poker (WSOP) in the $1,500 no limit hold'em event. A decade later he finished 2nd in the same event at the 1988 WSOP.
At the 1990 WSOP Lund was heads-up against Mansour Matloubi. On the decisive hand, he had a slight chip lead before the hand started, when with A-9 offsuit he called a pre-flop raise from Matloubi. He raised Matloubi's bet on the 9-4-2 flop, to put him practically all-in. Matloubi called with 10-10. An ace on the turn meant Lund only had to avoid the last two tens in the deck for the championship, but a 10 came on the river. He eventually finished runner-up, with Matloubi taking the title. 
He also finished in the money of the main event in 1991 (19th), 1992 (3rd), 2006 (315th), and 2007 (319th).
Lund went on to win a second bracelet at the 1996 WSOP in the $1,500 Ace to Five Draw event.
In addition to his two bracelets, Lund won a Hall of Fame watch, the Super Bowl of Poker main event and the Best All-Around Player Award at the Diamond Jim Brady tournament.
Lund retired from playing tournaments on a regular basis in 1997. He made a resurgence on the tournament circuit with two deep finishes at World Poker Tour events in 2007. He finished in 20th place at the L.A. Poker Classic, and 15th place at the Bay 101 Shooting Star. He also cashed in the 2006 and 2007 WSOP Main Events and in the 2006 Five-Diamond World Poker Classic championship event.
His total live tournament winnings exceeded $2,900,000, with his 22 cashes at the WSOP accounting for $1,079,504 of those winnings.
Lund died November 6, 2009 in Mound House, Nevada, at the age of 59, after a long battle with cancer.
