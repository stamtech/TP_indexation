The group first met in August 2005 whilst playing poker as beginners at The Gutshot Poker club in London, England. Impressed with each others poker abilities they decided to share poker strategy and discuss ways they could improve their poker skills as a group. Soon after meeting they started touring the UK, European & World Poker tournament circuit.
Since the formation of 'The Hitsquad' the five have had success on the UK, Europe & World poker tournament circuit with winnings in excess of $6,000,000 between them. The group hold many poker titles but most notably two WSOP Bracelets, (both by Praz Bansi), three GUKPT title's (Praz Bansi, Sunny Chattha, Karl Mahrenholz) and a Poker Million title (James Akenhead). In 2009 Bansi and Akenhead both signed sponsorship deals with Full Tilt Poker.
The group often posts news & blogs regarding their poker experiences on their website.
The Hitsquad has had very notable success at the WSOP which is held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada and the WSOPE which is held annually in London, England. As of 2010 the group has two victories (bracelets) and 31 money finishes (the highest of which was Akenhead's 9th place finish at the 2009 Main Event). 
Launched in 2007, the GUKPT is a poker tour held in various locations of the United Kingdom. The Hitsquad has three victories and fifteen money finishes.
