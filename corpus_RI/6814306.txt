The '''Massacre at Ywahoo Falls''' (or the '''Great Cherokee Children Massacre''') is alleged to have occurred on Friday, August 10, 1810, at Yahoo Falls, now in the Daniel Boone National Forest in southeast Kentucky, in which women and children of the Cherokee were supposedly massacred.  The primary source of the story is "The Great Cherokee Children Massacre at Ywahoo Falls", written by Dan Troxell
According to the tale, in order that the women and children of the Cumberland River valley might acquire a white-man's education, the Reverend Gideon Blackburn proposed to open a school on Cherokee land 125 miles away near Chattanooga (the story claims the school was in Sequatchie Valley), and on the day in question it was arranged that anybody seeking protection at the school should meet at Yahoo Falls at full moon.  According to the story, they were to be led by the supposed "Cornblossom", alleged daughter of the War Chief Doublehead, but were instead massacred by a contingent of soldiers sent by John Sevier, who was from the State of Tennessee not the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Doubt has been expressed as to whether the massacre ever actually occurred.
On August 12, 2006, persons unknown placed an unofficial monument to the alleged massacre in the Daniel Boone National Forest (DBNF), next to the grave of one Jacob Troxell, who died 10 October 1810.  In late September 2007, DBNF officials removed the monument for two reasons: first, it is illegal to put up a monument on federal land without permission, and second, they questioned whether the incident had actually taken place.
