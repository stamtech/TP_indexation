Bolling is a strong critic of US President Barack Obama and has, at times, been accused of racism in his comments on Obama. On May 23, 2011, Bolling criticized Obama for maintaining his state visit to Ireland rather than cutting the trip short to travel to tornado-damaged Joplin, Missouri, saying that the president was "chugging forties" (a slang term for malt liquor) in Ireland.http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-business-eric-bolling-says-president-obama-was-chugging-forties-instead-of-going-to-joplin/ Critics of Bolling charged that his statement was intentionally pandering to racial stereotypes of African Americans, especially since Obama had been pictured drinking a pint glass of beer and not a 40 ounce.http://thinkprogress.org/media/2011/05/24/169212/eric-bolling-40oz/ Bolling responded by saying that his comments were not based on stereotyping and repeated his criticism of Obama's absence in Missouri.http://twitter.com/#!/ericbolling/status/72824606691561472http://twitter.com/#!/ericbolling/statuses/72839248176357376
On Jun 10, 2011, Bolling again attracted controversy when he referred to President Obama's meeting with Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba at the White House as " a hoodlum in the hizzouse." The phrase was particularly criticized because it was juxtaposed with images of the rapper Common. Bolling later apologized for the segment, stating "we got a little fast and loose with the language."
