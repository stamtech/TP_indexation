The '''Volvo F88''' was a heavy vehicle introduced in 1964. It was a particularly advanced vehicle for its time, with an all-steel-constructed cab at a time when some British manufacturers were still producing wood-framed with alloy panelling vehicles. Also, unusually for the late 1960s, it was available with a sleeper cab with additional space behind the driver where a bunk was fitted.
Power outputs ranged from 260hp to 318hp DIN (290bhp BS AU 141)with an 8 or 16 speed gearbox. This was another major selling point, as a typical UK 32 ton articulated truck of the time made do with a 180hp Gardner and a 6 speed gearbox. The extra power made the F88 a particularly fast truck and it gained instant popularity, thanks also to its unheard of levels of road holding and driver comfort, with fully adjustable seating, heater and radio.
A derivative of the F88 was the G88 introduced in 1969, which was basically the same vehicle but with the front axle fitted 30 cm further forward to allow greater axle spread, necessary to increase the gross vehicle weight in Sweden up to 52.5 tons. The G-version was sold mainly in Sweden, Norway and Australia. The fact that today's trucks are built over exactly the same receipt as the F88 proves that it was decades ahead of its time. The last F/G88 left the assembling line in 1978.
The F88 today is regarded fondly by many as the first of the modern generation of "driver friendly" trucks, and in Europe is recognised as "THE" classic truck, with examples in good condition worth a great deal of money.
