The '''Volvo B5L''' (sometimes known as the '''Volvo B5LH''' or '''Volvo BRLH''') is a hybrid-electric powered bus built by Volvo since 2008.
The design of the chassis is similar to that of the Volvo B7L. It could be fitted with Volvo's own I-SAM parallel hybrid drive system and Volvo D5E engine.
It can save up to 35% on fuel consumption and reduces the emission of green house gases, including carbon dioxide. 
The first batch of six Volvo B5L double-deckers were built in 2008, they were fitted with Wright Eclipse Gemini bodywork and one example was shown in Euro Bus Expo 2008 in National Exhibition Centre, Solihull, England. These buses entered service with Arriva London in 2009.
The Volvo B5L is also built as a single-decker with Volvo's own bodywork, and sold as '''Volvo 7700 Hybrid'''.
In May 2010, Volvo announced that following several years of research and development, it would start serial production of the B5L and 7700.
