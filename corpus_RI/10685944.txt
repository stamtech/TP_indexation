Located on a spacious campus in Tambaram Sanatorium, the NIS project is a perfect example of Centre and State cooperation. The capital cost has been shared by the Government of India and Government of Tamil Nadu in the ratio of 60:40 and the recurring expenditure is shared in the ratio of 75:25. 
The campus is eco-friendly. This is an exceptional project to have created a man-made pond in our institutional premises as a water conservation measure. A sewage recycling plant provides water for the herbal and garden. Solar energy is being tapped to heat 12,000 litres of water every day, by using solar panels. It is proposed to develop the hillock behind the campus into a grove of medicinal plants.
The National Institute of Siddha has excellent infrastructure, dedicated and highly knowledgeable faculty members and bright students.  This Institute is poised to reclaim the glory of Siddha System so that the system can play a major role globally in the field of health care.
The Institute will soon evolve into a centre of excellence and a unique referral institute for Siddha system of medicine.
