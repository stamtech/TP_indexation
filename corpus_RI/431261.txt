It was launched on January 17, 1976 from Cape Canaveral, or Cape Kennedy in Florida by a Delta rocket. Designed for a two year mission it was the basis of experiments past its intended lifetime until November 1979 when a system failure broke all contacts with it. Unlike most communications satellites of the period, which had spin stabilized bodies covered with solar cells, the Hermes CTS was three-axis stabilized and had its solar panels spread out on two huge "wings".
The satellite was meant to test the practical aspects of a high powered satellite using large antennas beaming television signals directly to homes equipped with small antennas, and two-way communications with mobile stations. When it was launched it was the most powerful communications satellite in existence.
Several communities in the Canadian wilderness participated in a series of realistic tests of its capacities. Experiments in telemedicine for Emergency medical service, teleconferencing and community TV were conducted. The satellite was also used to televise Stanley Cup hockey playoffs to Canadian diplomats in Peru to demonstrate its international capacity. It covered about 40% of the Earth's surface, from its geostationary orbit. In Canada alone 37 tests were done using a family of 27 ground terminals. The experiments led to the creation of the hybrid Anik B satellite which was both a standard Anik model and a platform for pilot projects of direct broadcast TV.
In 1987 Canada's Department of Communications and NASA received an Emmy award for developing direct broadcast TV satellite technology with the Hermes CTS program.
