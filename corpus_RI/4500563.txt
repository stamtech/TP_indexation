Route 422 was formed on 16 January 1988 from the split of route 122, which was withdrawn between Bexleyheath and Plumstead. The 422 was initially run by Bexleybus between Bexleyheath and Woolwich, providing an overlap with route 122 between Woolwich and Plumstead. ''londonbusroutes.net''
The poor performance of Bexleybus resulted in the route being passed to Boro'line towards the end of 1988. During February 1992, Boro'line was bought out by Kentish Bus (now part of Arriva). Arriva lost the contract to run the route to London Central on 23 January 1999.
As part of the Millennium Celebrations, and the redevelopment of the Greenwich Peninsula, new transport links were needed to the Millennium Dome at North Greenwich, so the 422 among other routes was chosen for an extension from Woolwich to the new North Greenwich tube station on 25 May 1999.
In January 2009 a bus on route 422 was involved in an arson attack in Bexleyheath.
On 22 January 2011, Go-Ahead London retained the contract of route 422 and had bought in brand new Volvo B9TL 10.4m / Wright Eclipse Gemini 2s to replace the Volvo B7TL 10m / Plaxton Presidents.
