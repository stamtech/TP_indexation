Volvo Cars operates one of its largest automobile plants, Torslandaverken in Torslanda, under the motto "Increased capacity     for ever-higher quality." 
It also holds the headquarters for Volvo Car Corporation and AB Volvo.
From 1923 to 1977, prior to the opening of the Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport, the city had been served by the Torslanda Airport, located here. The control tower, located on a hilltop adjacent to the site of the airport, was renovated in 2007, and is one of the last remaining artifacts of the airport, much of which was demolished in 1997. 
In recent years, the original land from the Torslanda Airport has been redeveloped into a residential area known as Amhult, eventually to become a garden village with 900 new homes, a commercial centre, preschool and school.
Notably, '''The Blue Hangar''' was destroyed by a fire, May 31, 1980; a monument marks the place where the hangar stood.
Prior to its use as a defacto museum, the Torslanda Airport hangars had served as presentation spaces for prominent vehicle debuts, including the 1957 Volvo P1900/Sport. 
Elizabeth Stride, nee Elisabeth Gustafsdotter &mdash; believed to have been the third victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper &mdash; hailed from '''Torslanda''', and had been christened at the Torslanda Church (pictured).
