The services originally used just 10- followed by a 3-digit number, such as '''10-321''', but quickly ran out of numbers. They advertised various savings over traditional long-distance companies.
The carrier access code had always existed previous to the late 90s round of advertising, originally conceived as a way for consumers to shop around and try other long distance carriers. In practice it was little used and extremely obscure. In the late 80s those computer modem users who dialed long distance from strange places commonly used it to use better quality long distance lines. 
The services were advertised heavily, using celebrities such as Alf, John Lithgow, Reginald VelJohnson, John Stamos, Tony Danza, James Garner, Christopher Lloyd, Dennis Miller and George Carlin. This ubiquitous presence on television led to an inevitable spill-over into pop culture for a brief time.
By the early 2000s, the steep discounts were no longer offered, rates increased as much as 80 percent in fall 2002, with 10-10-321 going from 10 cents a minute to 18 cents on October 1, 2002. A year earlier, a 9.9 percent "Universal Service Fund" charge had been added. The television advertising has since become much less common. In addition, the widely increased use of cell phones in the early 2000s, and subsequent decline in the use of landline phones, has rendered the service somewhat antiquated.  Much of this is because many phone service plans do not charge additionally for long distance calls (cell phones, Vonage, VoicePulse, etc.).
Both 10-10-220, 10-10-321, and other 10-10 services are still available, although at significantly higher prices than originally advertised. The current rate for the 321 service is a flat 20   per minute, while the 220 service runs $1.20 for the first 10 minutes and 20   for each minute afterward.
