AMOS-2 carries Eleven Ku-band transponders. 
Weighing 1370&nbsp;kg at launch, AMOS-2 incorporated a 400 newton Liquid Apogee Boost Motor (ABM) and Fourteen 10 newton Reaction Control Thrusters for raising the satellite's orbit from Geo-stationary Transfer orbit to its final geo- stationary orbit as well as for its altitude control. It carried 450&nbsp;kg of propellant (monomethyl hydrazine and MON-3). 
AMOS-2 measures 11.5 m in length in its final in-orbit configuration. It is 3-axis body stabilised using Sun and Earth sensors, momentum and reaction wheels. Its solar array generates 1700W power, backed up by 24 A  h Ni-Cd batteries. 
After its launch into Geo-synchronous transfer orbit by Soyuz, AMOS-2 was taken to its final geo-stationary orbit by firing the apogee boost motor in phases. After it reached the geo-stationary orbit, its antenna and solar Panels were deployed and the satellite was finally placed in its allocated slot of 4   W longitude.
