Non-notable biography.  "Michael E. Arth" gets 65 Google hits with only 17 unique results.  "Michael Arth" gets about 500 results and a lot don't relate to the subject of this article including a t-shirt designer, a principal, and a young Democrat member from Harvard.   18:11, 11 July 2006 (UTC)
I read somewhere that 250,000 art prints of his have been sold. He has a published book. There have been a number of articles written about him.
Don't delete. How about instead a less notable length for a less notable biography?   01:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
DO NOT DELETE: This biography has been reduced in size and wikified. 03:39, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
Metros232, I came up with 18,700 Google hits on Michael E. Arth and 28,100 hits under Michael Arth, for a total of 46,800 hits. I have no idea how many are unique to this particular Michael E. Arth, but after looking at several random pages, I'd say it's a lot.  He was also a rock poster artist in the early 70s, and fine art posters he did in the 70s and 80s are still in circulation--so it's the same Arth, as artist, house designer/builder, urban designer, writer etc, etc.. He's had a lot of incarnations and at least a few of them are notable 04:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
Oddly, a second search through Safari came up with over 160,000 Google hits for Michael E. Arth and Michael Arth. Curious. Pablo Picasso brought 810,000 hits. There is probably only one Pablo Picasso though vs.  maybe 4 or 5 Michael Arths. 04:25, 14 July 2006 (UTC)  
Metros232, That's strange. Do you have some finely tuned search system? If so,I'd like to get that. I reran the searches. I now realize that for my Safari search it was going through Yahoo, not Google. Sorry about that. So I ran both Yahoo and Google. I came up with a total of 185,700 for Yahoo and a total of 47,000 for Google. I copied them here for you to see: 
Yahoo search: 
Google search: 
Web Results (Michael E. Arth) "1 - 10 of about 18,900. Search took 0.10 seconds."
Anyway, my point is that Arth is at least somewhat notable. I reduced the size of the bio to reflect his somewhat notable status. For that reason, I say DO NOT DELETE!

Uncle G, the Google test IS listed as an "alternative test" for inclusion as a biography. I agree it should not be the only test. So, in addition to passing the alternative test (as has been demonstrated above) Arth has these points in favor of inclusion: 
1. At least 30 articles written about him that can be read online
2. Coffee table art book, Introspective 1972-1982 published in 1983, and still available online. This book has an impressive amount of work, but doesn't even mention that he was also a rock concert poster artist for a while in the early 70s (the t-shirt connection cited above by Metros232 above was actually a link to Michael Arth's poster art, not another Michael Arth) 
3. Hundreds of thousands of art prints sold during the time he was a fine artist 1970s and 1980s. 
5. Founder of New Pedestrianism, a variant of New Urbanism
6. Writer of many articles and the text of Introspective
7. subject of two documentaries currently in production: The Labors of Hercules: Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems, and another one about building a new town in Kenya being produced by Canadian mutual funds expert Duff Young. 
8. He rebuilt 30 slum homes and businesses in DeLand, Florida and received various awards for that. He's got another 92 homes and businesses in development in the Garden District. After he ran out the drug dealers he renamed "Crack Town" The Garden District.

This article will be rewritten and expanded. Suggestion at New Pedestrianism will be taken also--to merge material at New Pedestrianism with both Michael E. Arth and New Urbanism. 19:48, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
