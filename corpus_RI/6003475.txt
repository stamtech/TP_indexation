Yahoo! created the service in hopes that it would drive larger traffic to their site and would give them an advantage over larger online media companies such as Google or MSN, which are Yahoo!'s largest competitors in terms of search engines that provide services and web features to its customers.  Unlike other social networking sites, Buzz allows the publisher to modify the submission.
Yahoo! announced on April 19, 2011 that it was killing off Buzz as of April 21, 2011. "This was a hard decision. However this will help us focus on our core strengths and new innovations", the company wrote in a brief statement.
