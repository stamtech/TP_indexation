The '''Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts''' is a confirmed new performing arts center to be built in Downtown Orlando, Florida, United States.  It will replace the Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre, originally built in 1926.  The new performing arts center is scheduled to open in 2012.  Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles is the design architect, with acoustics by Artec Consultants and Theatre Project Consultants designing the theatres.
The venue was approved along with a new Amway Center (to replace Amway Arena) and improvements to the Citrus Bowl after a series of hearings and votes, culminating in final votes in the Orange County Board of County Commissioners on July 26, 2007, and the Orlando City Council on August 6, 2007.
The design for the new venue was revealed on August 21, 2008.  The venue will feature a 2,800-seat amplified hall for Broadway theatre-class play events, a 1,700-seat acoustic hall for ballet, operas and orchestral performances, and a 300-seat venue for smaller functions.
The venue will cost US$408 million.  Two-thirds of the funding comes from public funds, largely from the Orange County, Florida, tourist development tax.  The other one-third comes from private donations, including a large grant from the Dr. P. Phillips Foundation, the philanthropic organization funded through the estate of Dr. Philip Phillips.
A slow-down in the tourist development tax and other economic conditions have forced the plans to become phased.  The amplified hall and the 300-seat venue are planned for phase I.   Groundbreaking is planned for June 2011.
