NC 86 travels north from its southern terminus at US 15-501/NC 54 Bypass (Fordham Boulevard) in Chapel Hill, passing through the UNC campus, and the town center. Exiting Chapel Hill into rural Orange County, NC 86 meets I-40 before arriving in Hillsborough. There, the route meets I-85 and then joins NC 57 for about a mile through Hillsborough's central business district. Splitting to the northwest (signed north), NC 86 briefly joins NC 49 as they cross the Caswell County line.
Entering the small community of Prospect Hill, NC 86 splits from NC 49 and travels north toward Yanceyville. Just outside Yanceyville, NC 86 joins U.S. 158 and crosses NC 62. After passing through central Yanceyville, US 158 splits west while NC 86 continues north to the North Carolina   Virginia state line, where the route continues as State Route 86 and travels into Danville, Virginia.
Prior to 1940, this was numbered as NC 14. It was renumbered to match up with Virginia's State Route 86. Simultaneous with that change, the old NC 65 was renumbered as NC 14.
