A product of Mooroolbark, in Melbourne's outer eastern suburbs, Mitchell was recruited to the Hawthorn Football Club in the AFL in the 2001 AFL Draft with selection 36 (received in the deal which saw Trent Croad and Luke McPharlin head to Fremantle, and the numbers one Luke Hodge and 36 (Mitchell) selections go Hawthorn's way). The first half of his debut season in 2002 saw him playing with the Box Hill Hawks, until he broke into the Hawthorn side midway through the season due to some amazing form. Following some unimpressive performances where he never managed more than 14 disposals, he was dropped for Round 15 but was recalled after more eye-catching performances in Round 19. It turns out he polled 31 votes in just 11 games for the VFL's best and fairest award, the J. J. Liston Trophy which was the main reason for his constant recalls to the Hawthorn side.
In 2003 Mitchell continued to improve, winning the AFL Rising Star award and becoming known as "the Extractor" (particularly by commentator Brian Taylor) for his high amount of clearances and ability to win the ball out of middle of the ground.
A solid season followed in 2004, and in 2005 he played a "super" season until a foot injury sidelined him in Round 15. For the 2006 season, Mitchell was named vice-captain of Hawthorn and displayed stellar form throughout the season culminating in winning the Peter Crimmins Medal for Hawthorn's best and fairest.
In 2007 he capped of another wonderful season by coming 3rd in the votes for the highest honour in Australian Football, the Brownlow Medal with 21 votes, 1 short of joint 2nd place winners, North Melbourne's Brent Harvey and Brisbane's Simon Black who both polled 22 votes, and coming 8 votes behind winner of the 2007 Brownlow, Geelong's Jimmy Bartel.
On 6 October 2007, during the Peter Crimmins Medal Event, he was announced as Hawthorn's next captain, taking over the reigns from retiring captain Richard Vandenberg.
Mitchell was ineligible for 2008's Brownlow Medal following a tripping charge against Melbourne in round nine.
On Saturday, 27 September, Mitchell captained the Hawks to the 2008 Premiership, the first in 17 years and the clubs 10th, beating the reigning premiers, Geelong, by 26 points. Mitchell was reported for rough conduct against Geelong superstar Gary Ablett, Jr. in the second quarter, however this report was dismissed at the conclusion of the weekend.
At the end of the 2010 season he handed the captaincy over to Luke Hodge, who was made captain of the 2010 All-Australian team.
Mitchell married Lyndall Degenhardt in early November 2009. They have a son called Smith, born in 2010 and twin daughters Emerson and Scarlett born in 2011.
