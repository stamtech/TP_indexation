Violette often played poker with family members as a child.  Her family relocated to Las Vegas when she was 12 years old; Violette took to playing casino poker once she reached the legal age.  She spent a short time as a casino employee, working as a blackjack and poker dealer.
In 1984, Violette cashed in a poker tournament in Lake Tahoe and used the proceeds to launch a professional poker career.  She later took the top prize of $74,000 at a seven-card stud tournament at the Golden Nugget; at the time this was the biggest tournament prize ever won by a woman.  Shortly thereafter, she married her second husband, and took a two year hiatus from poker.
In 1990, Violette returned to the poker scene by winning $62,000 in a tournament at Caesars Palace.  She maintained her residence in Washington state but split time between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
In 1993, Violette divorced her husband and relocated to Atlantic City.  She continued to work the poker tournament circuit and was a regular participant in the World Series of Poker (WSOP).  She has also competed on the World Poker Tour.
At the 2004 World Series of Poker, Violette won a bracelet in the seven-card stud high-low split tournament. She was one of three women (Kathy Liebert and Annie Duke being the others) to win a gold bracelet in an open tournament in that year's WSOP.
Violette is a team member of the Full Tilt Poker online poker site.
As of 2010, her total live tournament winnings exceed $1,200,000. Her 29 cashes at the WSOP account for $845,609 of those winnings.
Violette has one child, a daughter named Shannon.
